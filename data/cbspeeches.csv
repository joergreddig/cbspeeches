"1","2014-02-12 - ECB - Mario Draghi.txt","It is a pleasure to speak today at this conference marking the 20th anniversary of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), and in particular to be part of this session that recognises and celebrates the contribution of Alexandre Lamfalussy.
The discussion today has naturally focused on the EMI, the euro and monetary policy, but I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on another issue which is vital for the single currency, and to which Alexandre has made an immense contribution - that is, financial integration.
Financial integration and the single currency are in many ways two sides of the same coin. One fundamental reason for the single currency was to maximise the benefits of the single market for capital. And, conversely, it was understood when the euro was conceived that integrated financial markets would be necessary for an effective single currency.
Alexandre's experience in academia, the private sector and central banking put him in a unique position to contribute to this process. He contributed intellectually, for example through his leadership of the SUERF network set up to promote discussion of financial and monetary issues among academics, central bankers and market participants. He contributed practically, not least as chairman of Euro-MTS, the European electronic fixed income market, late in his career. And he made significant policy contributions, from overseeing the creation of the TARGET payment system at the EMI to launching what became known as the “Lamfalussy process” for supervisory and regulatory convergence in Europe.
For this reason, the ECB recognised and honoured his role by establishing about ten years ago a “Lamfalussy Fellowship” programme. It sponsors five young economists each year to conduct research on the integration, structure and performance of the European financial system.
However, we know - and to our cost - that ultimately the euro area did not succeed in achieving sustainable financial integration. While financial integration deepened significantly after the euro was introduced, the global financial crisis caused that process to go into reverse. And we can see the importance of financial integration for the single currency all the more in its absence.
In the periphery, financial fragmentation has led to high interest rates for firms and households, and disrupted monetary policy transmission. In the core, it has led to exceptionally low interest rates for savers and potentially distorted asset prices. Consequently, the whole of the euro area would benefit from lasting financial reintegration - and indeed, addressing financial fragmentation has been one of the key tasks of euro area policy-makers, including the ECB, over the past years.
What I would like to focus on today is one aspect of reversing fragmentation that is perhaps underplayed - that is, the importance of raising the quality of financial integration in the euro area. My view is that the incomplete financial integration we achieved before the crisis made it susceptible to fragmentation. But I am confident that with a banking union we can create the pre-conditions for more sustainable financial integration in the future.
Let me start by outlining how financial integration evolved before the crisis.
It was always understood that financial integration could have both stabilising and destabilising effects. Some of the main stabilising effects were expected to come from increased portfolio diversification. As banks and other investors became more diversified across borders within the euro area, they could reduce their exposure to domestic shocks, and this would be reflected in greater income and consumption risk-sharing. Indeed, global and European evidence suggested that financial openness and integration had reduced consumption growth volatility.
Another benefit of financial integration was thought to come from improved allocative efficiency. Research suggested that large cross-border banks in Europe could improve overall economic performance, by making sure that productive capital was channelled towards the most efficient firms. This would in turn reduce the risk of crises stemming from mispriced investment risk.
Destabilising effects of financial integration, on the other hand, were expected particularly through risk-taking and contagion. Asymmetric information problems associated with cross-border lending could lead to misaligned incentives and increased risk-taking. Similarly, savings imbalances abroad could compress risk premia and lower financing costs, allowing an increase in leverage in the domestic financial sector. And if negative shocks were to occur, contagion could quickly spread through the interbank market, and lending to the real sector across borders could be affected, too.
As financial integration deepened, it was anticipated that the stabilising effects would overall be more important than the destabilising ones - that is, the welfare benefits of better diversification and improved allocative efficiency would offset the welfare costs of occasionally higher risk-taking and contagion effects. So why were the costs of the European crisis so high?
There are many reasons for this, but in my view one important factor was the incomplete nature of financial integration in the euro area. Price convergence in many asset classes created an appearance of financial integration, but it was in fact relatively shallow, in particular in the banking sector. According to the ECB's financial integration indicators, while euro area interbank markets became almost completely integrated, retail banking integration remained largely fragmented. This mismatch had at least three consequences.
The first was on the asset side of banks' balance sheets. A main channel through which retail banking integration is expected to improve allocative efficiency is by increasing the distance between the main shareholders and management of a bank and the vested interests in the country where the bank operates, i.e. by reducing so-called “related lending”. But without meaningful foreign competition, these gains did not materialise in the euro area. In fact, the ability to borrow freely in interbank markets allowed local banks to increase lending towards favoured domestic sectors such as real estate. This is essentially what we saw in Spain and Ireland. In the process, financial integration concentrated rather than diversified risk.
The second consequence was on the liability side of banks' balance sheets. As banks' funding from abroad came mainly through the interbank market, the composition of their foreign liabilities was short-term and debt-based. This meant that funding could quickly dry up at the first sign of distress. With a more integrated banking sector, however, this effect would have been less dramatic. As foreign banks would have equity stakes, they would have an incentive to maintain cross-border funding within the group. This is what happened, for example, in the Baltic countries where foreign ownership of the banking sector was high.
These two consequences combined to create a third effect. As banks' assets were not well allocated, nor well diversified geographically, they were more vulnerable to domestic shocks. And as their foreign liabilities were mainly interbank, i.e. not equity-based and short-term, they could not share the subsequent losses with other jurisdictions. This meant that when the crisis hit, the cost of repairing their balance sheets fell largely on their domestic fiscal authorities. The result was the infamous bank-sovereign nexus that has perpetuated financial fragmentation in the euro area.
My conclusion from this experience is as follows: the quality and comprehensiveness of integration matters. There are costs which can arise from a type of financial integration that is short-term and reversible; or from having perfect integration in one market and fragmentation in another. A key question for the euro area is therefore: how can we generate a higher quality of financial integration for the future?
The pre-crisis experience suggests three changes are needed.
First, stronger ex ante supervision to mitigate the possible destabilising effects of financial integration. Second, an improved policy framework to maximise the stability benefits, namely by encouraging deeper cross-border banking integration. Third, better ex post risk-sharing arrangements, such as resolution frameworks, so as to prevent shocks from spilling over to sovereigns.
I see that a banking union - the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the new European resolution framework - can make a significant contribution to these objectives. Let me address each in turn.
Strengthening supervision
To begin with, the SSM will enable supervisors to better identify emerging risks and to act counter-cyclically. This is thanks to its independence, its incentives and its instruments.
The SSM has been designed with the necessary independence to lean against localised booms, being not only legally independent, but also independent of any single government or national financial system. And that independence is reflected throughout its organisational structure, for example by having mixed-nationality joint supervisory teams to supervise each significant bank.
By virtue of its accountability, the SSM also has incentives that are clearly aligned with its European financial stability objective - it has to answer for the failure of any bank in the SSM area. Compared with national supervisors, this gives it all the more reason to take account of excessive risk-taking and the cross-border externalities associated with it, and therefore to be proactive if local financial developments pose increasing systemic risk.
Finally, the SSM has not only micro-prudential powers but also new macro-prudential instruments to counter financial imbalances. For all the instruments in the EU legislation, it may apply stricter measures than national authorities if it observes emerging risks. This further strengthens the capacity at the European level to prevent financial instability.
Deepening integration
The SSM can also help maximise the benefits of financial integration by providing a policy framework that is more conducive to cross-border banking integration.
Before the crisis, supervisory coordination mainly took place through the Lamfalussy process and committees, which were a major step forward and the best that could be achieved at the time. However, they were unable to fully iron out supervisory differences between EU jurisdictions. This presented cross-border banks with substantial compliance costs and reduced the economic synergies of integration.
For example, a Commission survey in 2005 found that opaque supervisory approval procedures were a major deterrent to cross-border banking M&As in Europe. The need to comply with different sets of rules and interact with several different authorities was also reported to be a barrier to cross-border activity.
The lesson from this period was that, while financial integration is ultimately a market-driven process, policy plays a key role in creating the conditions for it to progress. To quote the Lamfalussy report, “the EU has no ‘divine right' to the benefits of an integrated market - it has to build one”. This SSM should help us in this building process.
A single supervisor automatically removes some of the dividing lines between jurisdictions that create compliance costs. For example, there will no longer be a distinction between home and host supervisors for cross-border banks. Instead, there will be a single supervisory model and eventually a single supervisory culture, rather than one per country. And cross-border groups will be able to report at the consolidated level.
Another benefit of the SSM - and perhaps a more important one - will be the lack of “hidden barriers” to cross-border activity linked to national preferences. With a European supervisor, borders will not matter. Issues such as protecting national champions or supervisory ring-fencing of liquidity will not be relevant. This means that banks will be in a better position to achieve the economies of scale that were promised by the single financial market - and that they also need to be competitive at the global level.
It is of course for banks to decide whether such integration makes business sense. And some obstacles to cross-border integration that lie outside the remit of supervision - like company law and tax - still remain. However, the low profitability and excess capacity of the European banking sector suggests that efficiency gains could be achieved, and without exacerbating the “too big to fail” problem.
Improving risk-sharing
Even with a higher quality of financial integration, we know that shocks may still occur that cannot be contained within the private sector. The US, for example, has a well-integrated financial market, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) still plays a prominent role in managing crises. Our challenge in the euro area is to ensure that, when banks fail and the public sector has to intervene, it does not result in a recurrence of the bank-sovereign nexus. The new European resolution framework will be key to achieving this.
This framework can help insulate sovereigns by improving private risk-sharing within the euro area. First, it will ensure that the costs of bank failure are borne first and foremost by the private sector, with sovereigns providing funds only in exceptional circumstances. The key innovation here is the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, which provides the legal underpinning for the bail-in of shareholders and creditors and other resolution tools.
Second, the new framework will allow resolution costs to be more evenly spread across the euro area banking sector, and less concentrated in the affected countries, thus enhancing the potential for cross-border risk-sharing. Specifically, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) will introduce a single resolution fund that is funded by and available to all euro area banks.
Will this help break the bank-sovereign nexus today? In my view, the impact will certainly be positive. The fact that the costs of any bank rescue will fall less on sovereigns should lift expectations of government debt sustainability, thus improving asset quality for banks exposed to their governments. And the fact that bail-ins will precede bail-outs means banks' funding costs should be better decoupled from the fiscal condition of their sovereigns.
That said, in terms of breaking this nexus, there are some elements in the Council agreement on the SRM that I believe could be improved. The main problem is uncertainty about resolution financing arrangements. This is important, because if markets cannot ascertain ex ante how resolution will be financed, and in what quantities, they may find themselves having to price-in a residual risk of national government involvement, thus perpetuating the bank-sovereign nexus.
One issue that creates uncertainty is the protracted time period - currently 10 years - over which national compartments are to be mutualised into a single resolution fund. As legacy risks will be addressed by the ECB's comprehensive assessment, this seems an unduly long period. We would see merits in doubling the pace of mutualisation to have a genuine European fund within five years. To be clear, this would not imply that banks have to pay higher fees. The fund would still only reach its target level after 10 years, yet it would be a truly single fund after five years.
Another issue that needs clarifying is what backstop arrangements will be in place in this transition period, and also in the steady state. What makes resolution authorities credible is the knowledge that, when private sector solutions do not suffice, they can draw on temporary public bridge financing. This steadies expectations and supports financial stability.
Indeed, the job of a resolution authority could become more complicated if there are doubts about the adequacy of its resources in times of systemic stress. Even in the US, where such a public backstop is in place, the FDIC felt that its job was complicated during the financial crisis by media scepticism about its finances.
For this reason, we believe that a single resolution fund needs a solid public backstop - be it an ability to temporarily borrow from the market backed by guarantees from participating Member States, or access to a credit line, potentially from the European Stability Mechanism. This would not be a transfer system between taxpayers: as in the US, such borrowing would be recovered by additional levies on the banking sector in the future. Therefore, the only transfer would be an intertemporal one among banks.
To conclude, financial integration is essential for a well-functioning single currency, but it is not something we can take for granted. We have learned a painful lesson here. Incomplete financial integration is an Achilles heel: it creates vulnerabilities and is liable to fragment. With the banking union, I am confident we are laying the foundations for more complete financial integration in the future.
There are two final points I would like to make.
First, while I have spoken mainly about banking sector integration, a single financial market must also ultimately extend to capital market integration - a theme that was close to Alexandre's heart. There are still several barriers to such integration, and these call for the attention of policy-makers. One example is barriers to high-quality securitisation of bank loans, whose removal may help to promote lending to households and SMEs, and reduce fragmentation. In the spirit of Alexandre, we need to begin addressing these issues in a pragmatic manner, while never losing sight of our goal.
Second, we should not forget that fragmentation also comes from the demand side. If less competitive countries undertake structural reforms that promote higher economic growth, their economies will converge towards more competitive ones, and finance will tend to follow. This is why, in addition to the banking union, the re-establishment of country competitiveness is essential to reintegrate financial markets. In other words, all participants have to help achieve and sustain financial integration.

"2","2014-03-31 - Fed - Janet Yellen.txt","I am here today to talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to help our nation recover from the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the effects of which were particularly severe for the people and the communities you serve.
Part of that effort has involved strengthening the financial system. New rules are in place to better protect consumers and ensure that credit is available to help communities grow. The Federal Reserve also plays a role in communities by fostering dialogue that promotes community development. I will highlight some initiatives around the Federal Reserve System that I believe are making a real difference. Later today, I will visit the Manufacturing Technology Program at Daley College, on Chicago's south side, where adult students are acquiring the skills they need to connect to good-paying jobs in that sector.
The Fed supports the work you do in communities because you make a difference. You help ensure that credit is available for families to buy homes and for small businesses to expand. Your organizations sponsor programs that help make communities safer and families healthier and more financially secure. One of the most important things you do is to help people meet the demands of finding a job in what remains a challenging economy. And that help is crucial, but I also believe it can't succeed without two other things.
The first of these is the courage and determination of the people you serve. The past six years have been difficult for many Americans, but the hardships faced by some have shattered lives and families. Too many people know firsthand how devastating it is to lose a job at which you had succeeded and be unable to find another; to run through your savings and even lose your home, as months and sometimes years pass trying to find work; to feel your marriage and other relationships strained and broken by financial difficulties. And yet many of those who have suffered the most find the will to keep trying. I will introduce you to three of these brave men and women, your neighbors here in the great city of Chicago. These individuals have benefited from just the kind of help from community groups that I highlighted a moment ago, and they recently shared their personal stories with me.
It might seem obvious, but the second thing that is needed to help people find jobs...is jobs. No amount of training will be enough if there are not enough jobs to fill. I have mentioned some of the things the Fed does to help communities, but the most important thing we do is to use monetary policy to promote a stronger economy. The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps since the onset of the financial crisis to spur economic activity and create jobs, and I will explain why I believe those efforts are still needed.
The Fed provides this help by influencing interest rates. Although we work through financial markets, our goal is to help Main Street, not Wall Street. By keeping interest rates low, we are trying to make homes more affordable and revive the housing market. We are trying to make it cheaper for businesses to build, expand, and hire. We are trying to lower the costs of buying a car that can carry a worker to a new job and kids to school, and our policies are also spurring the revival of the auto industry. We are trying to help families afford things they need so that greater spending can drive job creation and even more spending, thereby strengthening the recovery.
When the Federal Reserve's policies are effective, they improve the welfare of everyone who benefits from a stronger economy, most of all those who have been hit hardest by the recession and the slow recovery.
Now let me offer my view of the state of the recovery, with particular attention to the labor market and conditions faced by workers. Nationwide, and in Chicago, the economy and the labor market have strengthened considerably from the depths of the Great Recession. Since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the economy has added more than 7-1/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen more than 3 percentage points to 6.7 percent. That progress has been gradual but remarkably steady February was the 41st consecutive month of payroll growth, one of the longest stretches ever.
Chicago, as you all know, was hit harder than many areas during the recession and remains a tougher market for workers. But there has been considerable improvement here also. Unemployment in the city of Chicago is down from a peak of nearly 13 percent to about 9-1/2 percent at last count. That is about the same improvement as in the larger Chicago metro area, where unemployment has fallen to 8-1/2 percent. Metro Chicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide. 
But while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy and the job market are not back to normal health. That will not be news to many of you, or to the 348,000 people in and around Chicago who were counted as looking for work in January. It will not be news to consumers or to owners of small and medium-sized businesses, who surveys say remain cautious about the strength and durability of the recovery.
The recovery still feels like a recession to many Americans, and it also looks that way in some economic statistics. At 6.7 percent, the national unemployment rate is still higher than it ever got during the 2001 recession. That is also the case in Chicago and in many other cities. It certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older workers who lost long-term jobs, and to African Americans, who are facing a job market today that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the Great Recession.
In some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession. The numbers of people who have been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a year are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago. We know that the long-term unemployed face big challenges. Research shows employers are less willing to hire the long-term unemployed and often prefer other job candidates with less or even no relevant experience.
That is what Dorine Poole learned, after she lost her job processing medical insurance claims, just as the recession was getting started. Like many others, she could not find any job, despite clerical skills and experience acquired over 15 years of steady employment. When employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became a disqualification. Even those needing her skills and experience preferred less qualified workers without a long spell of unemployment. That career, that part of Dorine's life, had ended.
For Dorine and others, we know that workers displaced by layoffs and plant closures who manage to find work suffer long-lasting and often permanent wage reductions. Jermaine Brownlee was an apprentice plumber and skilled construction worker when the recession hit, and he saw his wages drop sharply as he scrambled for odd jobs and temporary work. He is doing better now, but still working for a lower wage than he earned before the recession.
Vicki Lira lost her full-time job of 20 years when the printing plant she worked in shut down in 2006. Then she lost a job processing mortgage applications when the housing market crashed. Vicki faced some very difficult years. At times she was homeless. Today she enjoys her part-time job serving food samples to customers at a grocery store but wishes she could get more hours.
Vicki Lira is one of many Americans who lost a full-time job in the recession and seem stuck working part time. The unemployment rate is down, but not included in that rate are more than seven million people who are working part time but want a full-time job. As a share of the workforce, that number is very high historically.
I have described the experiences of Dorine, Jermaine, and Vicki because they tell us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot. First, they are a reminder that there are real people behind the statistics, struggling to get by and eager for the opportunity to build better lives. Second, their experiences show some of the uniquely challenging and lasting effects of the Great Recession. Recognizing and trying to understand these effects helps provide a clearer picture of the progress we have made in the recovery, as well as a view of just how far we still have to go.
And based on the evidence available, it is clear to me that the U.S. economy is still considerably short of the two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress. The first of those goals is maximum sustainable employment, the highest level of employment that can be sustained while maintaining a stable inflation rate. Most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I estimate that the unemployment rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment is now between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent, well below the 6.7 percent rate in February.
The other goal assigned by the Congress is stable prices, which means keeping inflation under control. In the past, there have been times when these two goals conflicted fighting inflation often requires actions that slow the economy and raise the unemployment rate. But that is not a dilemma now, because inflation is well below 2 percent, the Fed's longer-term goal.
The Federal Reserve takes its inflation goal very seriously. One reason why I believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to provide substantial help to the labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence I see that there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market. Let me explain what I mean by that word ""slack"" and why it is so important.
Slack means that there are significantly more people willing and capable of filling a job than there are jobs for them to fill. During a period of little or no slack, there still may be vacant jobs and people who want to work, but a large share of those willing to work lack the skills or are otherwise not well suited for the jobs that are available. With 6.7 percent unemployment, it might seem that there must be a lot of slack in the U.S. economy, but there are reasons why that may not be true.
One important reason relates to the skills and education of people in the workforce. It is no secret that America faces some daunting challenges in educating people and preparing them to work in a 21st century, globalized economy. Many of you in this audience are helping workers address this challenge, but you also know that the economy continues to change very rapidly.
To the extent that people who desire to work lack the skills that employers are demanding, there is less slack in the labor market. This is an example of what economists call ""structural"" unemployment, and it can be difficult to solve. Even understanding what workers need to appeal to employers is difficult in a fast-changing economy. For government, effective solutions for structural unemployment, beginning with improved education, tend to be expensive and take a long time to work. The problem goes deeper than simply a lack of jobs.
But a lack of jobs is the heart of the problem when unemployment is caused by slack, which we also call ""cyclical unemployment."" The government has the tools to address cyclical unemployment. Monetary policy is one such tool, and the Federal Reserve has been actively using it to strengthen the recovery and create jobs, which brings me to why the amount of slack is so important.
If unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the jobs available, then the Federal Reserve's efforts to create jobs would not be very effective. Worse than that, without slack in the labor market, the economic stimulus from the Fed could put attaining our inflation goal at risk. In fact, judging how much slack there is in the labor market is one of the most important questions that my Federal Reserve colleagues and I consider when making monetary policy decisions, because our inflation goal is no less important than the goal of maximum employment.
This is not just an academic debate. For Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and Vicki Lira, and for millions of others dislocated by the Great Recession who continue to struggle, the cause of the slow recovery is enormously important. As I said earlier, the powerful force that sustains them and others who keep trying to succeed in this recovery is the faith that their job prospects will improve and that their efforts will be rewarded.
Now let me explain why I believe there is still considerable slack in the labor market, why I think there is room for continued help from the Fed for workers, and why I believe Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and Vicki Lira are right to hope for better days ahead.
One form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the unemployment rate or payrolls, some of which I have touched on already. For example, the seven million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job. This number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past experience, and the existence of such a large pool of ""partly unemployed"" workers is a sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate. Statistics on job turnover also point to considerable slack in the labor market. Although firms are now laying off fewer workers, they have been reluctant to increase the pace of hiring. Likewise, the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs is noticeably below levels before the recession; that is an indicator that people are reluctant to risk leaving their jobs because they worry that it will be hard to find another. It is also a sign that firms may not be recruiting very aggressively to hire workers away from their competitors.
A second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has not helped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries. Workers in a slack market have little leverage to demand raises. Labor compensation has increased an average of only a little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical standards. Wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before the recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity, and those forces are undoubtedly still relevant. But labor market slack has also surely been a factor in holding down compensation. The low rate of wage growth is, to me, another sign that the Fed's job is not yet done.
A third form of evidence related to slack concerns the characteristics of the extraordinarily large share of the unemployed who have been out of work for six months or more. These workers find it exceptionally hard to find steady, regular work, and they appear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to find a job. The concern is that the long-term unemployed may remain on the sidelines, ultimately dropping out of the workforce. But the data suggest that the long-term unemployed look basically the same as other unemployed people in terms of their occupations, educational attainment, and other characteristics. And, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the short-term jobless do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally improved for both groups. That is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-term unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term unemployed. This fact gives me hope that a significant share of the long-term unemployed will ultimately benefit from a stronger labor market.
A final piece of evidence of slack in the labor market has been the behavior of the participation rate the proportion of working-age adults that hold or are seeking jobs. Participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a job give up trying to find one. When the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age population was part of the labor force. Participation dropped, as it normally does in a recession, but then kept dropping in the recovery. It now stands at 63 percent, the same level as in 1978, when a much smaller share of women were in the workforce. Lower participation could mean that the 6.7 percent unemployment rate is overstating the progress in the labor market.
One factor lowering participation is the aging of the population, which means that an increasing share of the population is retired. If demographics were the only or overwhelming reason for falling participation, then declining participation would not be a sign of labor market slack. But some ""retirements"" are not voluntary, and some of these workers may rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy. Participation rates have been falling broadly for workers of different ages, including many in the prime of their working lives. Based on the evidence, my own view is that a significant amount of the decline in participation during the recovery is due to slack, another sign that help from the Fed can still be effective.
Since late 2008, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to revive the economy. At the height of the crisis, we provided liquidity to help avert a collapse of the financial system, which enabled banks and other institutions to continue to provide credit to people and businesses depending on it. We cut short-term interest rates as low as they can go and indicated that we would keep them low for as long as necessary to support a stronger economic recovery. And we have been purchasing large quantities of longer-term securities in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates the rates that matter to people shopping for a new car, looking to buy or renovate a home, or expand a business. There is little doubt that without these actions, the recession and slow recovery would have been far worse.
These different measures have the same goal to encourage consumers to spend and businesses to invest, to promote a recovery in the housing market, and to put more people to work. Together they represent an unprecedentedly large and sustained commitment by the Fed to do what is necessary to help our nation recover from the Great Recession. For the many reasons I have noted today, I think this extraordinary commitment is still needed and will be for some time, and I believe that view is widely shared by my fellow policymakers at the Fed.
In this context, recent steps by the Fed to reduce the rate of new securities purchases are not a lessening of this commitment, only a judgment that recent progress in the labor market means our aid for the recovery need not grow as quickly. Earlier this month, the Fed reiterated its overall commitment to maintain extraordinary support for the recovery for some time to come.
This commitment is strong, and I believe the Fed's policies will continue to help sustain progress in the job market. But the scars from the Great Recession remain, and reaching our goals will take time. In the meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will continue to expand its efforts to promote community development. The Board and each of the 12 Reserve Banks have community development staff members who focus on improving the availability of financial services in low- and moderate-income communities. They help bankers comply with the Community Reinvestment Act, but they are also a source of research and a facilitator of communication among financial institutions and practitioners to identify and share best practices.
This conference is one example of how the Fed pursues those goals, and I would like to mention a few of the Fed's other community development initiatives that I find particularly promising. In 2012, The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco partnered with the Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF), a community development financial institution that bridges the gap between low-income neighborhoods and private capital sources, to publish the book Investing in What Works for America's Communities. This book cited innovative and effective community development initiatives across the country and advocated for a ""Community Quarterback"" model to coordinate initiatives and better leverage funding among groups with similar goals.
In a similar way, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been the catalyst for the Working Cities Challenge, inspired by its own research on cities that managed to diversify away from a declining, manufacturing-based economy. The research found that one key to success is ""collaborative leadership,"" when governments, businesses, and nonprofits unite behind one focused approach. The Working Cities Challenge promotes that principle by inviting smaller Massachusetts cities to consider how they would use collaborative leadership to unite their communities to address a major challenge for lower-income residents. Twenty cities competed for $1.8 million in funding from the state and other sources. Six cities were awarded funds this past January, but many more will benefit from the spread of a new approach to capacity building that Fed research shows helps communities thrive.
Leadership recruitment is also at the heart of a grassroots-oriented program called Economic Avenue that was developed by the Kansas City Fed. In Northeast Kansas City, Kansas, residents and neighborhood leaders are forming a leadership council that will have responsibility for managing the program, which aims to create and grow local businesses, create jobs, and promote homeownership. The bank's community development staff is providing education and training to get the council off the ground, will measure and evaluate its progress, and assist in connecting leaders to resources and other programs.
These examples are just a few among many throughout the Federal Reserve System. By testing ideas, developing better measurement tools, convening interested parties, and sharing the Federal Reserve's skills and knowledge with our partners at the national and local levels, we aim to serve as a catalyst to improve lives.
Through these initiatives, together with the use of monetary policy and steps to safeguard the financial system, the Federal Reserve is committed to strengthening communities and restoring a healthy economy that benefits all Americans. It is my hope that the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and millions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives.

"3","2017-09-14 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","It was on this day exactly ten years ago – 14 September 2007 – that savers lined the street in front of the UK bank Northern Rock in order to rescue their savings. They had lost confidence in their bank upon hearing the news that it had applied for an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
This financial assistance was the last hope for Northern Rock, which by that time was unable to obtain funding from the markets. Given the prospect of loan losses, the institution was no longer able to find any takers for its piles of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which in the past had been a key source of funding for the bank. This was the first run on a UK bank in 150 years.
As we now know, Northern Rock would not be the only bank to run into trouble owing to the financial crisis and subsequent economic crisis.
The financial market turmoil caused the sharpest drop in GDP in post-war history. The severity of the contraction caught not only the general public, but also economists, off guard. As recently as 2003, Nobel Prize winner Robert Lucas  had declared the central problem of depression prevention to have been solved.
A year later, Ben Bernanke,  then a Governor at the USFederal Reserve, delivered a speech in which he laid out what he regarded as the most striking economic development in the past 20 years: the extreme economic stability in the industrial countries.
Much like Francis Fukuyama, in his influential book The End of History and the Last Man, hoped that the end of the Cold War would put an end once and for all to the clash between the major ideologies, so, too, did many economists think the end of major economic crises was within reach.
This assessment rested on the observation that, since the mid-1980s, inflation and GDP had been moving with an unprecedented degree of synchronicity. This is why Ben Bernanke’s speech was entitled, fittingly, ""The Great Moderation"".
He attributed the increasingly stable pattern of economic development primarily to better monetary policy: in the 1960s and 1970s, economic and central banks were still beholden to the idea that monetary policy could exploit a permanent trade-off between inflation and unemployment, where, by accepting a little more inflation, policymakers could keep unemployment down for good.
As Ben Bernanke outlined in his speech, this idea turned out to be wrong. Higher inflation is NOT able to keep unemployment down in the long run as, once inflation has gone up, labour, and the unions, form expectations that this expansionary monetary policy – and thus higher inflation – will persist in the future as well. They therefore demand higher nominal wages to offset the attendant real purchasing power losses. Which counteracts the creation of jobs. It is a phenomenon which economists call the time inconsistency problem.
Monetary policy which is geared towards short-term employment growth or which even attempts to push unemployment below its structural level will only end up delivering higher inflation rates. This is what transpired in the 1970s and early 1980s, when inflation in the major industrial countries averaged roughly 8½ percent. Decisive factors included not only energy-related price rises but also central banks’ increasing tilt towards employment-driven monetary policy and the absence of central bank independence in many quarters.
A monetary policy that is focused on safeguarding monetary stability, on the other hand, will tend to lessen volatility in economic activity. If a central bank’s efforts to fight inflation are credible, wage moderation will also ensue. This, in turn, will have a stabilising impact on economic activity.
In his remarks, Bernanke expressed the hope that monetary policymakers would not forget the lessons of the period of skyrocketing inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s and that the era of macroeconomic stability would persist for a long time to come.
However, as we all know, even at that time risks to financial stability were beginning to appear on the horizon which would later unleash massive turmoil in the financial system and trigger a severe economic crisis.
Central banks around the world responded to the financial crisis – and to the sovereign debt crisis that struck the euro area later on – by resorting to measures hitherto deemed inconceivable: by reducing interest rates to zero or even below that, by providing more or less unlimited liquidity, and by purchasing assets on a large scale.
But did that mark the advent of a new monetary policy paradigm – or has the monetary policy approach remained unchanged, on the whole? I would like to focus in my lecture today on how I believe liquidity should be made available in the future, whether government bond purchases should be a fixture of central banks’ policy toolkits, and what role monetary policy should play in financial system stability. Not all of these questions can be answered once and for all today. But look on the bright side: monetary policy debates will maintain their excitement in the future.
Ladies and gentlemen
I would like to begin by presenting what is arguably one of the most distinct symptoms of the recent financial crisis: the sudden rise in the provision of liquidity by central banks. As a case in point, excess liquidity in the euro area surged from €1.2bn in July 2007 to €230bn at the end of 2008. That may not seem like very much, compared to today’s figure of €1,668bn in excess liquidity, which is being expanded ever further thanks to the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme (APP), yet at that time it was a noteworthy increase.
Here is a simplified explanation of the monetary transmission mechanism in the euro area as it was seen prior to the financial crisis: the central bank changes interest rates on its short-term, largely risk-free refinancing operations, which then impacts on the interbank market. Banks then ""transmit"" the monetary policy stimulus to the rest of the financial market and then from there to the real sector. This is how monetary policy ""feeds into"" prices.
Once the crisis broke out, however, the monetary transmission process faced the danger of being halted abruptly.
Banks had doubts about the soundness of their counterparties. Risk spreads between secured and unsecured money market exposures skyrocketed, the volume of money market transactions declined, and the drying-up of the money markets forced banks to tap monetary policy operations for funding. The number of banks participating in monetary policy operations therefore rose sharply.
The Governing Council of the ECB reacted by switching its refinancing operations to tenders with full allotment. As long as banks were able to post sufficient collateral, they could thus obtain unlimited amounts of liquidity from the Eurosystem. In practice, this allowed them to bypass the strained interbank market.
The Governing Council also offered additional longer-term refinancing operations including, naturally, the three-year refinancing operations at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 in particular. It also reduced the rating threshold for certain types of monetary policy collateral, thereby giving banks greater scope for taking out Eurosystem refinancing loans.
The central banks of the Eurosystem – like those elsewhere in the world – thus took on, to a major extent, the money market’s role as an intermediary during the crisis. By acting as a lender of last resort to banks, they were able to contain the threat of massive bank runs.
This approach becomes a problem, however, once the ample provision of central bank money goes from being used to bridge temporary liquidity shortfalls to helping keep banks without a sustainable business model afloat permanently.
Those institutions will then tend to prolong their loans to legacy customers so as not to have to take a potential financial loss. However, they will subsequently also grant fewer new loans. This means that funding remains with less productive firms instead of being channelled towards more innovative firms. The situation in Japan should serve as a warning in this respect. 
Weak banks therefore tend to foster weak firms – and the attendant inefficient distribution of funding will dampen an economy’s innovativeness and dynamism.
Studies by the OECD  confirm that a non-negligible percentage of firms can be classified as ""zombie firms"". For instance, in 2013 28 percent of capital resources in Greece, 19 percent in Italy and 16 percent in Spain were sunk in firms that were unable to cover their cost of capital.
Economists Fabiano Schivardi, Enrico Sette and Guido Tabellini  show how the health of the banking system influences capital allocation. They estimate that credit misallocation in Italy reduced annual GDP growth by between 0.2 and 0.35 percentage point in the 2008 to 2013 period.
What we see, therefore, is that providing liquidity is a balancing act for central banks. Not providing enough liquidity could cause a spark to turn into a fire, while providing too much liquidity, and thus keeping ""zombie banks"" on life support, could cause the foundation of our competitive economic system to become brittle and shaky.
This dilemma cannot be resolved by monetary policy on its own. It is therefore important for banks to be sufficiently capitalised so as, for instance, to be able to cope with credit losses. For that reason, it is a good thing that banks now need to hold more and better-quality capital. They are also required to continue to shrink their holdings of non-performing loans.
This is ultimately all about, in particular, giving banks greater incentive to be more risk-aware in their decision-making processes than they were prior to the outbreak of the crisis. For that to work, it has to be ensured that institutions with riskier business models also pay higher risk premiums.
This, however, also requires investors to be correspondingly aware of risk in their own actions. And a decisive factor here is that banks, in a pinch, need to be permitted to fail – without bringing the financial system to its knees – and that investors and creditors, and not the tax payer, need to be first in line to pick up the tab for banks’ losses.
These factors are what make the new European rules for bank resolution, and their rigorous application, so important. Amidst all the contentious debate, recent events have shown, at least, that banks are now able to exit the market without jeopardising the functional viability of the financial system.
But in order not to thwart these rules, the Eurosystem has to return, over the long term, to a way of providing liquidity that is more in line with market conditions. The pre-crisis monetary policy framework had some merits in that respect. Banks obtained liquidity from the Eurosystem on terms that were not significantly more favourable than those on the interbank market. If central bank loans, which are not priced according to the credit institutions’ financial standing, are significantly more favourable than funding via the money market, the banks will have few incentives to lower their risk premiums by means of an appropriate risk management.
That also applies to longer-term refinancing operations. Interest rates for longer-term refinancing not being set by the market weakens banks’ inherent responsibility for their own liquidity and credit risk management. Furthermore, it distorts competition because institutions that do not have a sustainable business model can obtain funding from the Eurosystem over the long term irrespective of the risk involved – and do so, moreover, with collateral of lower quality than collateral on the interbank market.
Ladies and gentlemen
In the crisis, not only did the Eurosystem switch to full allotment of liquidity as well as expanding the collateral framework, it also launched purchase programmes for government bonds.
As early as May 2010, Greek sovereign bonds were being purchased under the Securities Markets Programme. To these were later added bonds from Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy – countries with a low credit rating.
In the summer of 2012, this programme was replaced, as you know, by the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme which – even though it never led to any purchases – has still had a perceptible impact on the capital markets.
And since 2015 the Eurosystem has been making large-scale purchases of sovereign debt under the public sector purchase programme.
In saying that, it is undisputed that such purchases have an effect on the monetary policy objective. Bundesbank analyses, too, show that government bond purchases have an expansionary effect on aggregate demand and inflation. There is, nevertheless, a large amount of estimation uncertainty, and different model approaches lead to very different assessments with regard to the effectiveness of such purchases. 
At the same time, government bond purchases also have some inherent unintended side effects. An analysis by the economists Viral Acharya, Tim Eisert, Christian Eufinger and Christian Hirsch,  for example, shows that the Eurosystem's OMT programme has impaired credit allocation in the euro area. The authors argue that the announcement of possible purchases of financially distressed governments’ bonds has stabilised the prices of such bonds and thus also the assets side of bank balance sheets. The authors say that the banks that have been shored up in this way have granted loans to less productive firms, thus adding to an inefficient allocation of credit.
But that is not the only respect in which government bond purchases targeted at individual countries’ risk premiums raise problems in the euro area. There is a hidden danger that using the central bank balance sheet to communitise fiscal risks will undermine the principle – enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty – of member states being individually responsible for their own finances. The possibility of passing on government liabilities to the European level reduces incentives for embracing fiscal prudence.
In order to mitigate this problem, the bonds of member states purchased by the national central banks under the present PSPPare also not subject to distribution of losses within the Eurosystem.
The bonds are, furthermore, being purchased in proportion to the ECB capital key. In that way, too, the Eurosystem is trying to avoid the moral hazard that could arise as a result of purchasing a disproportionately large amount of bonds issued by highly indebted governments.
In addition to that, purchases are restricted to a maximum of 33 percent per country and bond series. This limit was set so that the Eurosystem does not have to get into the awkward situation of having to prevent any restructuring of sovereign debt that may be deemed necessary. If the Eurosystem were to acquire too many bonds, it would have a blocking minority in any vote on a haircut. And it would have to make use of its blocking minority in order not to violate the prohibition of monetary financing.
But even below that threshold, the purchases have made the Eurosystem the member states’ largest creditor. What is more, in the context of asset purchases, changes in monetary policy impact much more directly on governments’ funding costs than interest rate moves do. This has additionally blurred the line between monetary policy and fiscal policy. Ultimately, if a return to monetary policy normality were called for, this could lead to the central bank coming under greater political pressure to keep funding costs at a low level – even if this were to the detriment of the objective of price stability.
Since, moreover, governments pay largely the same rate of interest on that part of their debt held by the central banks, for that part the disciplining effect of the capital markets is undermined, too.
Given the large number of problems, I regard government bond purchases purely as an instrument of last resort, say, when it comes to staving off a dangerous deflationary downward spiral of declining prices and wages. But I’ve said in the past that the fears of deflation are exaggerated. Now they have very largely disappeared.
Indeed, the economic recovery in the euro area is gaining further momentum and is broadly based. That is also evidenced by the upward revision of the ECB staff’s growth projection. The projection has also shown, however, that inflationary pressure remains rather subdued. The domestic price pressures identified in the projection are, however, quite consistent with a path towards our definition of price stability.
That fact that it’s taking a little longer to achieve our monetary policy objectives also has to do with enterprises and households in many euro-area countries still being occupied with reducing their high levels of debt in some cases.
And a number of crisis-affected countries have succeeded in strengthening their competitiveness and transforming current account deficits into surpluses. But improving price competitiveness through wage moderation is, naturally enough, also dampening domestic price pressures.
Given subdued inflationary pressure, an accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate in the euro area. Opinions can, admittedly, differ with regard to how much we should step on the pedal in terms of monetary policy and what instruments ought to be used for that.
In saying that, it is obvious that, even after the net purchases under the asset purchase programme have been discontinued, euro-area monetary policy will remain extremely accommodative. First, what is crucial for the degree of expansion in monetary policy is not so much the amount of monthly purchases but, above all, the total outstanding volume of sovereign bonds on our books.
And the amount held by the Eurosystem will remain at a very high level even when net purchases have been discontinued. After all, the Governing Council of the ECB has taken a decision to reinvest the proceeds from the maturing bonds.
Second, the Governing Council has decided not to raise interest rates until after the net purchases have ended. Speaking metaphorically, that means we’re not talking about slamming on the brakes but rather about no longer constantly putting our foot down on the accelerator.
With that in mind, too, the Governing Council of the ECB has to make sure it doesn’t miss the right moment for a return to normal in monetary policy. Precisely because the monetary conditions will continue to support economic activity for a long time to come, the question arises as to how much room for manoeuvre monetary policymakers will still have when the next downturn comes.
Ladies and gentlemen
Economics owes its name to the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He understood economics as a broad social science which had to be built upon a sound moral foundation.
To Aristotle, the concept of moderation was central in every way. According to this view, a true ""Great Moderation"" would surely not only mean a moderation of inflation and economic fluctuations, it would also involve avoiding excesses in the financial system.
So what does the new division of labour in macroeconomics look like? What role should monetary policy have in securing financial stability? This is, incidentally, a major focus of the Bundesbank’s research. The Bundesbank has formed what is known as the Trinity research network with Sweden’s Riksbank, the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to investigate the questions this raises.
One thing does seem obvious to me, however: monetary policy influences economic agents’ propensity to take risks. One of the aims of monetary policy today, of course, is to make riskier financial assets comparatively more attractive through very low risk-free interest rates – monetary policymakers are pinning their hopes on what is known as the portfolio rebalancing channel.
The figures bear this out: even the Germans, who tend to be very conservative in their investment decisions, are currently putting more money into potentially more profitable, but also riskier financial assets such as shares and mutual funds. And the exuberance on several asset markets in the euro area at the moment is certainly related to the low-interest-rate environment.
Monetary policy can therefore affect financial players’ willingness to take risks. And it also influences banks’ propensity to run risks in another, unintentional way: the more a central bank protects banks against potential risks and leads them to believe that they will receive central bank funding if the worst comes to the worst, the less wary they will be of taking on excessive risk.
Studies, amongst others by former IMF Chief Economist and Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, as well as Nobel Prize winner Jean Tirole provide compelling evidence that the implicit promise of a central bank to step in by lowering interest rates and providing liquidity in a crisis increases banks' appetite for risk.   
In other words, monetary policy affects financial stability. But does that mean that monetary policymakers should make financial stability an explicit objective, maybe even on a par with the objective of price stability?
That would be dangerous, in my opinion. The more objectives monetary policymakers pursue, the more likely that they will get mired in a conflict of objectives and be forced to weigh up one objective against the other. That could not only put monetary policy under greater political pressure, it might also give the impression of monetary policy arbitrariness.
This problem is especially pronounced when it comes to financial stability. After all, the concept of financial stability is much harder to grasp than that of price stability. Price stability can be depicted using a single indicator, the consumer price index. There is no one such indicator for financial stability. Financial stability is therefore often defined, very broadly, as a state in which the financial system performs all of its macroeconomic functions properly.
But the absence of a clear indicator with which to measure whether a monetary policy objective has been achieved can damage the credibility of monetary policy.
Moreover, a potential conflict of objectives between price stability and financial stability arises from the fact that monetary policy may not only help prevent financial imbalances. It can also mitigate their consequences after the event – by producing inflation, which reduces the real level of debt. There is, consequently, a short-term trade-off between the objective of price stability and that of financial stability, which can result in higher inflation in the long term.
Ladies and gentlemen
As always, the world is not just black or white: rejecting financial stability as an additional objective for monetary policymakers alongside the objective of price stability does not mean that central banks should shun responsibility for ensuring financial stability. After all, central banks generally possess a high level of expertise in analysing risks to financial stability.
However, the method of choice for combatting these risks is not monetary policy, it is macroprudential policy. Macroprudential instruments can be employed in a much more targeted way than monetary policy. In the case of the euro area, in particular, one of the key advantages of macroprudential policy is that it can be used to counteract, in a targeted manner, problematic national developments that cannot be addressed by the single monetary policy.
Macroprudential instruments include measures such as countercyclical capital buffers and measures that target the demand for credit, say actions aimed at containing exaggerations on the real estate markets. Caps on the loan-to-value or loan-to-income ratios are examples.
So where monetary policy is the hammer in a central bank’s toolkit in relation to financial stability, macroprudential instruments are the scalpel. Macroprudential instruments need not necessarily be used by central banks. In Germany, it is politicians who decide on the use of macroprudential measures, not the Bundesbank, and for good reason. Many of these instruments can have a fairly large impact on the way citizens lead their lives and therefore require democratic legitimacy.
And while I am on the subject of macroprudential measures: if anything can be said to be a winner of the crisis, it would probably be the word ""macroprudential"".
However, it goes without saying that banking supervisory measures are still necessary to ensure the soundness of individual institutions. The global turmoil of the financial crisis did, however, also show that the resilience of the financial system needs strengthening overall.
On this, we have made good progress since the crisis, thanks to Basel III. Mario Draghi, in his speech in Jackson Hole a few weeks ago, also stressed how important what has been achieved is for the stability of the global financial system.
Rolling back the reforms would therefore be extremely problematic, in my view. Of course, that does not mean that we should not evaluate the measures agreed upon and how they interact in order to achieve the objective of financial stability as efficiently as possible. The German G20 presidency has therefore launched a process on the Financial Stability Board to examine the cost-benefit ratio of individual regulations.
Does the existence of macroprudential instruments mean that monetary policy should stand idly by as financial imbalances build?
After the experiences of the crisis, that would be difficult to reconcile with the mandate of price stability. It may be advisable, even for a monetary policy that focuses exclusively on the objective of price stability, to heed developments on the financial markets.
As we have recently witnessed, financial crises have a considerable impact on the monetary policy transmission process and monetary policymakers’ ability to guarantee price stability. And yet financial crises almost always originate in excessively loose bank lending.  The last crisis was no exception. In the euro area, M3 growth rose from 5½ percent in 2004 to more than 11 percent in 2007. And loans to the private non-financial sector grew at a similar clip over this period. Monetary and credit aggregates are, therefore, good indicators of financial imbalances.
The second, monetary pillar of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy has therefore lost none of its importance. This is particularly true as monetary developments can provide valuable additional information for the economic analysis of the Eurosystem, as demonstrated, for instance, by the work of Volker Wieland  and of course by the Bundesbank's experiences.
The longer-term outlook provided by monetary analysis is important for another reason, too: macroeconomic variables such as the output gap are fraught with major estimation uncertainty. Uncertainty also surrounds the speed and intensity with which monetary policy impulses are implemented. Taking a slightly longer-term perspective can therefore help prevent monetary policy from succumbing to the illusion that it can micro-manage everything.
Incidentally, Claudio Borio, Chief Economist at the BIS, points out that the more you concentrate on the long-term perspective  , the more price stability and financial stability complement each other and no longer contradict each other.
Ladies and gentlemen
Monetary policy serves society best if it concentrates on safeguarding stable prices. This lesson of the ""Great Moderation"" remains true today.
Equally, it is also true that permanent macroeconomic stability cannot be achieved without financial stability. Here, macroprudential instruments are the method of first choice to ensure the financial system, too, finds a golden mean. If, however, financial stability risks build up and, for instance, excessive credit growth jeopardises longer-term price stability, monetary policy must not look on idly.
My personal contribution to finding the golden mean is that I will conclude at this point. I look forward to a lively debate!

"4","2017-10-18 - SSM - Danièle Nouy.txt","The public debate about banks is still very much defined by the financial crisis. When you say “banks”, people think “crisis”. And it is indeed true that the many echoes of the crisis can still be heard loud and clear.
Many of the challenges that banks face today can be traced back to the events of 2007 and 2008. For instance, legacy assets, such as non-performing exposures, still weigh on the balance sheets of some banks. Low interest rates weigh on their business models and profits. On top of that, banks have to deal with stronger rules and tougher supervision. And that, too, is a consequence of the crisis.
So yes, almost a decade on, the crisis is still very present in the minds of bankers, supervisors, regulators and the public. But at the same time, life goes on. And this means that there are still new challenges coming up.
Just think of technological change – digitalisation. So many aspects of our lives now fall under the influence of digital technology, and banking is no exception. The banks, therefore, have to think about how to make the most of it. They have to develop new products and new services, and, above all, face up to new competitors. It remains to be seen how this will play out.
And then Brexit suddenly happened. Brexit is a decision taken by the citizens of the United Kingdom that affects the entire European Union – all of us. And it also affects the banks, of course. One of the biggest issues for them is market access. Once the United Kingdom becomes a “third country” for the EU, banks located there will lose access to the European market, and European banks will lose access to the UK market. They will have to act, and there is not much time left to do so.
So while the crisis remains a focal point, other challenges have emerged. But there is still more than that. There are also challenges that stem from pre-crisis times. For many decades, the banking sector in Europe has been growing. And it may well have reached a point where it has grown too large – we could say that Europe is overbanked. So there is another thing that banks need to deal with: consolidation.
I think we can all agree that these are challenging times. So many things are happening that it has become quite hard to keep track of all of them. So let me just focus on one question: what role does regulation and supervision play in all this?
First of all, regulation too has been shaped by the crisis. It was the crisis that revealed gaps in the rulebook. And it was the crisis that reinforced the need to approach regulation at global level.
The result? A complete overhaul of the rulebook for banks to make future crises less likely. The plan was to make banks more resilient in general and create a global level playing field.
The rules now require banks to hold much more capital of much higher quality. They also require banks to build up liquidity buffers and comply with enhanced reporting and disclosure rules. This puts them on a stronger footing. From whichever direction the storm blows in, they can withstand it.
But we have to make sure that this is the case everywhere. Banking is global in scope and requires global rules. This prevents regulatory arbitrage and ensures that banks worldwide can compete on a level playing field. The ongoing work on Basel III aims to provide exactly that: a harmonised set of global rules.
But the consensus in favour of global rules has been weakening lately. In some countries, national tendencies are gaining the upper hand, and important elements of the rulebook might be postponed or dropped altogether. This is not good, of course. It increases the risk of another crisis – not just in one country but in all countries. That’s why we have to finalise Basel III as quickly as possible.
Agreeing on global rules is an important first step. But equally important is that the rules find their way through national legislatures and become law. The risk is that, during this process, rules become inconsistent between countries.
And to some degree, we can see that in Europe. True, there is a single European rulebook that transposes Basel III into EU law. It aims to level the playing field for banks across Europe. This is all the more important as a single European banking sector would naturally complement the Single Market and the single currency. But the single rulebook has not yet achieved its goal. In regulatory terms, the playing field in Europe remains uneven.
One reason is that parts of the rulebook come in the form of EU Directives. And such Directives are not directly applicable; they first need to be transposed into national law. It’s no surprise that the results differ from country to country. So in my view, legislators should rely more on EU Regulations, which are directly binding on all Member States.
Another reason for the uneven playing field lies in what are known as national options and discretions, or ONDs for short. The single rulebook contains a number of these ONDs, which give governments and supervisors some discretion in applying the rules. And they have used their discretion in various ways.
So in the end, the single rulebook does not provide fully harmonised rules. In a worst-case scenario there are 19 different national rules instead of a single European one. The playing field is still a bit uneven.
But we should not forget how far we have come. Despite the elements I just mentioned, we have made a lot of progress since the pre-crisis period. Guided by the lessons from the crisis, we have greatly improved the rulebook for banks.
So, just like for everything else, the crisis has left a distinct mark on the rules. But, as I said before, life goes on. The banking sector is constantly changing: new technologies are developed; new products and services are created; new competitors enter the market and, consequently, new risks may emerge.
Against this backdrop, the question is: how can the rules reflect all this change? Do we constantly need to adapt the rulebook? Well, obviously we can’t do that. It has taken us almost a decade to learn the lessons from the crisis – and we are still not quite done yet. So in a sense, the rulebook is like an oil tanker; it can take quite some time to change course.
But there is a way out. The rules must be designed in a way that allows them to embrace change without needing to be changed themselves. They must be sufficiently broad and principles-based. They should aim to make banks more resilient in general. And they should leave room for supervisory judgement.
However, there is a tendency to make rules as specific as possible, to add more and more details, so that they cover every eventuality. Well, in the first place, that is an unattainable goal. Even attempting to reach it would lead to a very rigid and complex set of rules. And this would impinge on supervisory judgement and open the door to regulatory arbitrage.
Supervisors would be less able to react quickly to newly emerging risks. Given all the change we see in the banking sector, this could turn into a risk itself. Ultimately, we need both solid rules and good supervision. We should not favour one at the other’s expense.
And this brings us to the topic of banking supervision.
Banking supervision has also been reshaped by the crisis – or by two crises in the case of Europe. Here, it was the financial crisis and the euro area crisis that made us rethink the way we supervise banks.
It was in 2012, when the turmoil in the euro area was at its peak, that European leaders took a big leap. They decided to create a European banking union. And the first pillar of this banking union was to be a single supervisory mechanism. Banking supervision was to be transferred from national to European level.
And here we are. Since 2014, the ECB has been responsible for supervising banks in the euro area. Our job is to provide tough and fair supervision based on harmonised standards and unbiased by national interests. In doing so, we help to make banks across the euro area safer and sounder.
Looking back, we had a challenging start. Neither the times nor the conditions were easy. In fact, they were extremely difficult. Still, we have come a very long way – much further than I expected at the beginning. So let me highlight a few of our achievements over the past three years.
First of all, European banking supervision is a massive project and we had very little time to set it up. It consists of the ECB and 26 national authorities from 19 countries. At the ECB alone, we recruited around 1,000 people, we created an organisation from scratch, and we specified our supervisory methods. In addition, we carried out a health check on all the banks that we were going to supervise. In my view, that was a great achievement. But frankly it was only possible because we are part of the ECB; we could not have done it on our own.
Second, we had – and still have – to deal with the fragmented rulebook that I already mentioned. We did what was in our power to harmonise it a bit more. We addressed, for instance, the national options and discretions in the rulebook that I already mentioned. Together with the national supervisors, we have agreed to exercise 130 of these ONDs in a harmonised manner. In the first instance, this was relevant for the 120 banks that we directly supervise. We have now extended the harmonised exercise of these ONDs also to the smaller banks that are directly supervised by the national authorities. But more needs to be done. There are still ONDs which lie in the hands of governments. These need to be harmonised, too.
Third, we have harmonised our main tool, the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, SREP for short. In the SREP we scrutinise each bank. We assess its business model, its governance structure and its risk management. We also assess risks to its capital and liquidity positions. With reference to the SREP, we make banks face up to their problems and deal with them. Denial is no longer an option.
One of the main advantages of our SREP is that we can compare and benchmark banks across the euro area. This helps us to identify best practices, spot new risks in time and deal with them. Thanks to the SREP, we can treat all banks in the euro area equally and help to make them safer and sounder.
The SREP is a great tool, but we need to refine it, of course. For instance, we have specified what we expect from banks with regard to the processes they use to assess and maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers – the ICAAP and the ILAAP.
Moreover, in addition to the SREP, there are many other tools that supervisors can use. But some have not yet found their way into the toolbox of European banking supervision. Among these tools are the moratorium powers, when declaring banks failing or likely to fail. That is something we still need to work on.
Our fourth achievement relates to the legacy assets of banks, as I already mentioned: non-performing exposures, NPEs for short. In parts of Europe, banks still carry high volumes of NPEs on their balance sheets. And that is a problem. It weighs on the profits of these banks, which is unfortunate at a time of already weak profitability. And more than that, NPEs keep banks from providing loans to the economy, which is unfortunate at a time when the economy needs to recover.
So we had to deal with this issue. That’s why we set up a high-level working group in 2015. Our first step was to publish qualitative guidance to banks on non-performing loans. The second step was to define what we expect from banks in quantitative terms for the steady state – particularly concerning the prudential provisions that they should set aside. This guidance was published for consultation at the beginning of this month.
Regarding the current stock, the legacy assets, we have asked the banks to come up with plans on how to reduce these exposures. Our supervisory teams have engaged with banks carrying too high levels of NPE to review and challenge the banks own plans and ensure that they address the issue in a both ambitious and realistic fashion. For those banks that are lagging behind, we intend to come up with additional quantitative guidance.
And that brings me to another issue. As European supervisors we help to make banks safer and sounder. But we need to be clear about one thing: it is not our job to prevent each and every bank from failing. Failure is part of a well-functioning market economy.
That’s why the banking union does not rest on European banking supervision alone. There is a second pillar: the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM for short. The SRM allows us to resolve failing banks in an orderly manner. This helps to strengthen market discipline and makes the banking sector more stable.
The good news is that the SRM and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) have now passed their first test. This year, three euro area bank failures were addressed effectively, efficiently and without disrupting the financial system. This success is also due to the fact that all the institutions involved cooperated very well: the European Commission, the Single Resolution Board, the national authorities and the ECB.
But this experience also revealed that we all need to be prepared to handle the failure of a bank. And this includes the banks themselves, of course. They too need to prepare for potential failure. This is also an area where we constantly and closely work together with the Single Resolution Board.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have now talked about the tools and the methods that we European banking supervisors use, and the challenges we face. But we need to look further. European banking supervision is more than that.
Through our work, we contribute to a level playing field for banks across the euro area. This in turn provides the foundation for a truly European banking sector. This is our objective.
Looking to the future, we want to see banks that offer their services throughout the euro area and reap the benefits of a larger market; savers that can choose from a wide range of options when investing their money, and corporations that can tap sources of funding across the euro area.
For that, we need more than a single rulebook and European banking supervision. We need a fully-fledged banking union – a banking union that rests on three pillars. And so far, only two of these pillars are in place; the third one – a single European deposit insurance scheme – is still missing.
So banks are supervised and resolved at the European level. But the negative consequences, if they fail, are felt mainly at the national level. There is a mismatch between European supervision and national liability. This mismatch needs to be resolved. It is time to build the third pillar of the banking union; it is time to set up a European deposit insurance scheme. This would further level the playing field and take us closer to a truly European banking sector.
Ladies and gentlemen, the banking sector is constantly changing. In recent years, most of these developments have been driven by the financial crisis. Now, they are driven by other elements, such as the digitalisation.
With that in mind, regulators have rewritten the rules since the crisis, and supervisors have rethought their approach to supervising banks – in Europe even more so than in other parts of the world. There are still things that need to be improved – no doubt about that. But all in all, we have come a long way in better ensuring that the banking sector is stable and serves the economy reliably.

"5","2017-10-30 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","I am pleased to be here with you at this reception to bid farewell to Alexander Sattler and to welcome Peter Kern as the Bundesbank’s representative in Mumbai.
Some may still wonder why the Bank’s representative in India isn’t located in your capital, New-Delhi. But a prime objective for us as a central bank is to stay close to our community. With the Reserve Bank of India based here in Mumbai, we have our peers and representatives of the financial community close by.
Mutual exchange is necessary in a globalised financial world. We all know that. But when it comes to issues we all currently face, we can sometimes focus so much on our own situation that we blank out the views and experiences of others. I therefore wish to take this opportunity of speaking before representatives of the Indian financial community to share my views on current financial matters that should be of concern for both Europe and India.
It is a rather gratifying task to talk about challenges when the global economy is actually in an encouraging state. We are seeing a sustained, broad-based upturn in industrial countries and consolidated growth in emerging markets. That was also one of the crucial takeaways from the IMF meeting in Washington. There was a unanimous view that the world economy has continued to strengthen. On top of this, the economic upswing is broadly based. Virtually all the industrial countries are performing somewhat better now than was expected at the beginning of the year. Having witnessed the global financial crisis and subsequent downward spirals, there is currently a feeling of relief. For the financial sector, growth typically provides new business opportunities and typically decreases credit risks.
The good thing about a stronger, brighter global economy is that this gives actors room for manoeuvre. Indeed, there is no better time to fix a leaky roof than when the weather conditions are fair.
And while we’re fixing the roof, we might want to carry out some additional precautionary measures to prepare us for the next storm. And indeed we should feel obliged to do so. While it can be easy to be carried away by the idea of an upward spiral where problems will miraculously fix themselves, good weather, unfortunately, doesn’t last forever.
We should therefore use this sunny spell not only to make important fixes – like accomplishing the full set of reforms initiated after the financial crisis – but also to carry out routine precautionary measures.
As far as monetary policy is concerned, we need to make sure that everyone is able to cope with a rise in interest rates. Given a strengthened macroeconomic environment and the expectation of higher inflation the Federal Reserve System has already increased its monetary policy rate. Both led to a rise in the long-term interest rates in the United States in the past twelve months.
And even in the euro area capital market rates went up – but less than in the US. One reason is that financial markets already expected that the ECB Governing Council will prolong its ultra-loose monetary policy. Indeed, the Governing Council has decided last week to reduce the monthly volume of its net asset purchases from 60 billion to 30 billion euro beginning in January and lasting at least until September 2018. But with this decision, ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council has by no means slammed on the brakes. It has rather layed off the gas pedal somewhat. Given the favourable current macroeconomic outlook and the upwards trend for domestic price pressure in the euro area a clear end time of net purchases would have been appropriate.
And so, in principle, the low interest rate environment in the euro area will be lasting. This intensifies the revenue problem of euro area banks. But even if longer-term interest rates in the euro area would rise in the tow line of US capital market rates, this would imply a challenge for euro area banks. Given my current role in the field of banking supervision, I am quite concerned about banks’ management of these interest rate risks. The key risk is then the so-called interest rate risk in the banking book. Only a few weeks ago, we published our 2017 survey of over 1,500 small and medium-sized German credit institutions. In a scenario of rising interest rates, while institutions would initially and on average face a sharp decline in profits, they would be better off in a medium-to-long-term. A comparable stress exercise has been done for large euro area banks as well. With respect to a change in the interest rate environment, a key lesson was that risks depend to a large extent on how banks are set up. Have they agreed on floating rate loans with their customers or on fixed rates? How long is their average asset duration? For a majority of large European banks in the test, higher interest rates would lead to largely contained risks and also a higher net interest income in three years’ time. An interest rate hike therefore poses individual challenges for banks and requires individual remedies.
Problems caused by the monetary policy change particularly in the US are, of course, not confined to financial institutions. There is a general and empirically tested idea that emerging countries may also suffer. Historically, we have witnessed large capital inflows to emerging countries in so-called “risk on” periods, where capital was abundant in advanced economies and when conditions nurtured the “search for yield”. Flights to safety or monetary tightening of the US dollar have led to capital outflows from emerging countries, currency depreciations, and financial crises. Recently, in the spring and summer of 2013, talks about monetary tapering led to sharp exchange rate reactions.
However, emerging countries are not completely at the mercy of global factors such as the monetary policy of large economies or international economic cycles. One obvious precautionary measure is to build up foreign exchange reserves. This ""safety shield"" allows these countries to dampen depreciation pressure. Indeed, emerging economies have accumulated a large stock of foreign exchange reserves in the last 15 years. Recent empirical research by the Bundesbank[1] indicates that foreign exchange reserves are indeed an effective tool to counter depreciation pressure. But it also shows that the monetary “safety shield” is not a cure-all. In order to keep private investors in the country, a country should rather strive for a healthy policy mix that targets domestic economic development.
Ladies and gentlemen, our concern for financial stability requires us to cast our net wide and always keep track of the latest developments in the most important economies of the world. For the Bundesbank, our representatives and representative offices abroad fulfil an important role in this respect.
I would like to first thank Mr Alexander Sattler for his service in Mumbai from October 2014 until September of this year. He has been here during eventful times. Among other things, India has seen a strong reform momentum – the reform of tax on goods and services being the most recent result. India’s reforms have received a lot of international attention. Throughout this period, the Bundesbank has benefited from our reliable hotline to Mumbai.
I would also like to warmly welcome his successor, Mr Peter Kern. The job at our representation requires not only all the professional knowledge, which he – like Mr Sattler – of course brings along. But this job is also a lot about personal contact, as I said in the beginning. For example, our Bundesbank representative in Mumbai always stands ready to present our views regarding current developments in the euro area and in Germany.
I can only encourage everyone here in this room to get in contact with Mr Kern whenever needed. Mr Kern may be new to India, but he is not new to this position. From December 2008 to January 2012 he was in our representative office in Sao Paolo, Brazil – which means he even stayed one year longer than the usual three-year term. He is a very open-minded person. One of his first preparations was to sign up for a Hindi language course.
I am convinced that Peter will – like Alexander Sattler – do a very good job sharing knowledge between India and Germany.

   It is a pleasure to join the FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) in reflecting on what’s happened in the two
   years since the Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR). This afternoon I would like to assess recent
   progress in building real markets for the good of the people and discuss the forward agenda for your
   important work.
   Two and a half years ago, FEMR set out a series of ambitious recommendations to restore confidence in
                                                                             1
   Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) markets.
   The FMSB’s work is an integral part of the FEMR solution.
   Your work matters because UK markets are essential for global commerce.
   The City has a special responsibility to address the root causes of misconduct given its pre-eminent position
   in global markets. The UK accounts for 40% of both global FX volumes and trades in OTC interest rate
   derivatives, and two-thirds of trading in international bonds. More international banking activity is booked in
                                       2
   London than anywhere else.
   Your work matters because the financial sector is an important contributor to UK prosperity.
   Finance is one of the largest sectors of the UK economy. Around 400,000 people are employed in financial
                                                                                     3
   services in London alone, 1.1 million across the country as whole. Their enterprise contributes £115 billion
   to our national income, £80 billion to our exports and £70 billion to the Exchequer, equivalent to two-thirds of
                         4
   the NHS budget.
   Your work matters because finance is not an end in itself; financial markets serve the real economy.
   By financing firms that hire, invest and expand, markets drive growth.
   By opening up cross border trade and investment, they create new opportunities for businesses and savers.
   By transferring risks to those most willing and able to bear them, markets help households and businesses
   insure against the unexpected.

   Most fundamentally, your work matters because markets are the best mechanism to drive innovation,
   productivity, and prosperity.
   The Problem
   Though markets are generally a force for good, markets can go wrong.
   Left unattended, they are prone to instability, excess and abuse.
   Following the global financial crisis, a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation
   undermined trust in banking, in the financial system, and to some degree, in markets themselves.
   In FICC markets, misconduct was revealed on a scale that impaired their ability to function fairly and
   effectively.
   The economic consequences have been enormous. Global banks’ misconduct costs have exceeded $320
   billion, capital that could otherwise have supported around $5 trillion of lending to households and
                    5
   businesses.
   More worrying still, an industry of the scale, importance and complexity of finance needs social capital as
   well as economic capital in order to operate, innovate and grow.
   Repeated episodes of misconduct have called the social licence of finance into question.
   In a system where trust is fundamental, it ought to be of grave concern that only 20% of UK citizens now
                                                                                6
   think that banks are well run, compared to 90% in the 1980s.
   The scale of the challenge of restoring trust is thrown into sharp relief by the FMSB’s comprehensive review
   of misconduct over the past two centuries. The history of financial fraud has rhymed all too frequently.
   Potential Solutions
   In the cycle of scandal, response, integrity, drift, and renewed scandal; potential solutions have oscillated
   between the extremes of Self Regulation and Total Regulation.
   Recent difficulties illustrate the problems with each of these approaches.

All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                   3

   By undervaluing the importance of hard and soft infrastructure to the functioning of real markets, light touch
                                                          7
   regulation led directly to the financial crisis.
   Multiple factors contributed to a tide of ethical drift in FICC markets. Market standards were poorly
   understood, often ignored and always lacked teeth. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the
   system nor recognised the full impact of their actions. Bad behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and
   eventually became the norm.
   Given the economic and social consequences of the ensuing disaster, it is right that regulators proscribe
   certain behaviours and set out their high level expectations. Yet, authorities cannot regulate for every
   circumstance, watch every transaction, or anticipate every market innovation. Total regulation is bound to fail
   because it promotes a culture of complying with the letter of the law, not its spirit, and because authorities
   inevitably lag developments in fast-changing markets.
   But it doesn’t have to be this way.
   A more comprehensive and dynamic solution combines public regulation with private standards and then
   buttresses them with a series of hard incentives which materially increase individual understanding and
   accountability.
   Market standards can be effective if they:
        -     Articulate clearly the market’s collective view of best practice, with worked practical examples to
              clarify grey areas;
        -     Are grounded in, and are reinforced by, relevant regulatory frameworks and requirements;
        -     Are kept current; and
        -     Are given teeth by incentives that foster adoption and adherence.
   An Early Assessment of the FMSB’s work
   So how is the FMSB doing in establishing common standards of market practice that are well understood,
   widely followed dynamically relevant?
   The FMSB is already making an important contribution.
   7
     “Hard infrastructure” refers to the way in which markets are organised. “Soft infrastructure” refers to the standards and norms,
   including regulation, market standards and codes, by which markets operate.
                                                                                                                                      4
All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                   4

   Drawing on the expertise of its members, the FMSB has finalised standards that codify best practice with
   respect to: reference price transactions, commodity binary options, and new bond issues. A standard on risk
   management transactions for new bond issues is nearly final, and an earlier draft standard on FX stop-loss
   orders has been absorbed into the FX Global Code.
   In each case, potential conflicts of interest are mapped to high-level principles designed to mitigate them.
   For reference price transactions, emphasis is placed on transparency with clients on mechanics and
   potential conflicts, and on mitigating the risk that the wider transactions of dealers could be market moving.
   The draft standard on risk management for new bond issuances sets out principles to mitigate risks around
   selection and formation of reference rates.
   The FMSB’s Statements of Good Practice, such as for surveillance of FX markets, provide more detailed
   guidance and worked examples to help set expectations.
   The FMSB is also scanning the horizon for future misconduct risks, including through its innovative
   behavioural cluster analysis. Rightly, given rapid changes in underlying market structure, this process has
   prioritised work on vulnerabilities arising from fast automated markets.
   Will These Standards and Codes Make a Difference?
   We know from history that codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows or enforces them.
   Why should the FMSB’s efforts be expected to help reverse the tide of ethical drift? Indeed, given the long
                                                                                                               8
   history of misconduct, aren’t such efforts akin to King Canute rebuking the waves?
   I’m more optimistic that the tide will turn because the FMSB is part of a much broader effort by UK authorities
   and market participants. Together, we have created a comprehensive and mutually reinforcing set of
   measures that strengthen the hard and soft market infrastructure.
   The resulting incentives give FMSB standards moral force and practical consequence.
   First, in the FMSB’s core work, the best in the market are taking responsibility for identifying and codifying
   best practice, in a way that complements and reinforces existing regulation. The FMSB now convenes senior
   participants from fifty global issuers, underwriters, asset managers, exchanges, custodians and investment
   banks. The breadth and engagement of the membership gives its standards credibility and creates peer
   pressure within the industry to promote adherence.
   8
     Canute, King of Denmark, England and Norway, 995-1035, reputedly set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the incoming
   tide to halt and not wet his feet and robes. Yet ""continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his
   royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none
   worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.'
                                                                                                                                              5
All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            5

   Second, peer pressure within firms should reinforce standards and, more generally, the commitment to real
   markets.
   Most banks have codes of ethics or business principles. These are necessary but not sufficient not least
   because it isn’t reasonable to expect every trader to absorb their meaning or to translate them readily into
   live situations. But it is reasonable to expect them to use FMSB guidance to help recognise the differences
   between a real market and a rigged one. And it is essential that business cultures encourage everyone to
   call out market abuse when it occurs.
   Third, buyside pressure for proper behaviour is made easier by clear, practical standards. This is formalised
   in the example of the FX Global Code, where major central banks including the Bank of England, have
   confirmed that they intend to adhere to the principles of the Code, and that they also expect the same of their
                                  9
   regular FX counterparties. Similarly, the Bank of England will adhere to the UK Money Markets Code and
   Precious Metals Code and will expect the same of its market counterparties.
   Fourth, the combination of new arrangements for compensation, the expectations of the Senior Managers
   Regime (SMR), regulation and market standards are mutually reinforcing. In the UK, a significant proportion
   of the variable compensation of key decision-makers must now be deferred for a period of seven years to
   ensure it can be clawed back over the time scales it generally takes for conduct issues to come to light.
   The SMR gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to develop, adopt and embed them.
   By requiring identification of the most senior decision-makers of banks, insurers and major investment firms,
   and setting requirements on them, the SMR re-establishes the link between seniority and accountability,
   strengthens individual accountability, and reinforces collective responsibility.
   Senior Managers can now be held individually accountable if they fail to take reasonable steps (including
   training or proper oversight) to prevent or stop regulatory breaches in their areas of responsibility.
   The SMR prescribes individual responsibilities – typically to the Chair and CEO respectively – for developing
   and embedding a firm’s culture, alongside a collective responsibility for the Board.
   And under the related Certification Regime, firms must also annually assess and certify the fitness and
   propriety of a wide range of risk-taking employees.
   To help meet all of these expectations, Senior Managers can draw on market standards in order to explain
   and promote good practice, assess their risk-takers, and build a strong culture.

   There are encouraging signs that the SMR is already beginning to make a difference.
   For firms, it is clarifying and improving governance, accountability and decision-making processes. Senior
   Managers are increasingly focusing on building cultures of risk awareness, openness and ethical behaviour.
                                                                                                                     10
   In the words of one chair “responsibility for culture has moved to the top of my agenda.”
   For supervisors, the regime is helping identify weaknesses in governance and accountability, and to assess
   the fitness and propriety of senior managers and others in positions of responsibility, and whether the firm
   has an appropriate culture, and is encouraging the necessary changes.
   In the first instance, consistent or widespread shortcomings would have consequences for compensation.
   More persistent failings could increase the capital that must be set aside for operational risks, and in the
   extreme, could influence our judgements regarding the fitness and propriety of senior managers.
   Over time, market codes may become more firmly embedded still, something on which the FCA is currently
                    11
   consulting.
   The Way Forward
   The mutually reinforcing relationship between the regulatory framework and market good practice should
   help the FMSB, and other market standard-setters, maintain their ambition and momentum even once
   memories of post-crisis misconduct fade.
   It could sharpen collective incentives to address, more conclusively, outstanding ambiguities that act as
   obstacles to real markets. And it should help mitigate emerging vulnerabilities.
   The Bank of England encourages the FMSB to consider where additional guidance and worked examples
   could buttress its existing standards, to guard against the risk that certain principles mean different things to
   different parties.
   The City’s special responsibility, given its pre-eminent position in global markets, is why it has brought so
   many ideas and such energy to advance reforms to address the misconduct risk that has plagued global
   markets.

      In light of its responsibilities for conduct and market integrity, the FCA is consulting on an approach under which it would formalise
   that in supervising to, and enforcing, SMR rules for unregulated markets and activities, it would consider whether firms and individuals
   are meeting “proper standards of market conduct” with reference to “recognised” industry codes. See FCA CP17/37 available at:

   These efforts have helped set the international agenda, with many of the themes identified in FEMR are
   finding support more broadly, particularly in the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB).
   The FSB’s misconduct action plan, presented to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in July 2017, includes:
        (i)      Developing new global standards of conduct in fixed income, commodities and currency
                 markets, of the sort that the FMSB has championed, as well the FX global code, in which UK-
                 based authorities and market participants played an important role;
        (ii)     Direct measures to strengthen financial institution governance and compensation structures to
                 align better risk and reward, including developing governance toolkits, which will address
                 individual accountability, firms’ risk culture, and the risk of ‘rolling bad apples’, (all of which are in
                 place in the UK); and
        (iii)    Reform of major financial benchmarks arrangements to reduce the risks of their manipulation.
   I would like to say a few words about this final strand before concluding.
   The goal of this work is to restore confidence in the integrity of key interest rate benchmarks globally.
   Reforms to the governance of Libor – which is vital hard infrastructure in UK markets and for many borrowers
   in the real economy – have gone a long way to meeting this objective. That is the good news. The bad
   news is that it has become increasingly clear that we cannot rely on Libor in the long term.
   Libor is meant to measure banks’ short-term unsecured funding costs. But the reality is that bank funding
   markets have changed, and banks no longer take enough wholesale term deposits to form the basis for a
   robust transaction-based benchmark.
   As we have pointed out in the past, the result is that Libor is overly reliant on expert judgement rather than
   actual transactions. That situation is neither desirable nor sustainable.
   There is also a risk that panel banks might withdraw from Libor and precipitate its collapse, which raises
   obvious financial stability concerns.
   So there is a clear need for the authorities and market participants, across every sector, to come together,
   and transition to alternative benchmarks.
                                                                                                                        8

   Under the auspices of the FSB, authorities in the UK, US, Japan and Switzerland have worked with market
   participants to identify alternative benchmarks. In the UK, the market-led Working Group on Sterling Risk
                                                                                                            12
   Free Rates recently confirmed SONIA as its preferred alternative to Sterling Libor.
   Market participants in every sector and market that uses Libor now need to come together to identify and
   resolve issues, change business practices, and adopt alternative benchmarks.
   To support the next phase of this work, the Bank and FCA are today announcing that from January, the
   Sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group will have a new mandate and wider representation from across the
   market. Its key objective will be to pursue a broad-based transition from Libor to SONIA by 2021. Buy side
   firms, issuers, infrastructure firms and trade associations will be brought into the Group alongside banks and
   broker-dealers.
   We are under no illusions about the complexity of the task. Libor is embedded throughout the financial
                                                                                  13
   system in derivatives, loans, bonds and commercial contracts.
   The Bank and FCA are committed to supporting UK market participants as they prepare for the transition.
   Reasserting London’s Leadership of Real Markets
   To conclude, two years on from FEMR, by working together, we are making enormous progress.
   We are moving from markets that collapse when there is a shock from abroad to markets that are resilient.
   From markets where transactions occur in chat rooms to markets that are professional and open.
   From markets where few were accountable for anything to markets where everyone is responsible for their
   actions.
   The FMSB is playing an essential role in this transformation.
   When your standards are combined with more robust regulatory requirements, new compensation
   arrangements and the Senior Managers Regime, we are achieving what Canute could not.
   The tide of misconduct is going out, revealing the real markets working for the good of the people of the
   United Kingdom and the world.
   12
      To facilitate a smooth transition, the FCA has coordinated panel banks to support Libor until the end of 2021.
