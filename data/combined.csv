"2014-01-16 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","I am delighted that so many of you have accepted the Tagesspiegel’s invitation. Before I begin, let me wish you all a happy and prosperous New Year.We are in Berlin. At the beginning of the year, the Governing Mayor announced what not to expect in 2014, namely the opening of the capital city’s new airport. Today I would like to talk about what we can expect - and what we must resolve to do - to overcome the crisis in the euro area on a lasting basis.In my speech I will examine the measures currently being taken to tackle the crisis - on which opinions are divided - and say a few words about the institutional reforms that are needed in the single currency area.Blaise Pascal rightly said, 400 years ago, as he looked ahead to the New Year, that all the resolutions have already been made, and that all we have to do is keep them. So you will recognise many of the points I am going to make from the discussion about the establishment of monetary union. Having said that, a need for action does exist: but it took the crisis to show us how significant the need for action is.First, however, I would like to start by examining the economic prospects for the New Year. And they don’t look all that bad.The German economy regained momentum last year, and according to our forecasts this upturn will continue this year and next.This upward trend has again stemmed primarily from domestic factors. Germany's domestic economy is therefore already significantly more dynamic than the modest rate of growth for 2013 as a whole might suggest.Low unemployment, continued growth in employment and favourable financing conditions are supporting private consumption and driving housing construction. But German foreign trade is picking up again, too. And that is likely to continue if the recovery in the global economy and the euro area becomes more broad-based.The Bundesbank’s economists expect the German economy to expand by 1.7 percent this year and 2.0 percent in 2015. Those are our forecasts based on our tried and tested economic models. But of course, these are expectations, not certainties.Making forecasts is a difficult business. In the mid-1800s it was predicted that the city of New York would be buried in horse manure by 1910 at the latest - but then came the automobile. And not everyone initially believed in the success of the motor car either. Kaiser Wilhelm II put his faith in the horse, playing down the automobile as only a temporary phenomenon. And even Gottlieb Daimler predicted that global demand for motorvehicles will not exceed one million - if only because of the lack of available chauffeurs.What I want to say is that forecasts - long-term forecasts in particular - should always be treated with caution. But short-term forecasts, too, can quickly become worthless if unforeseen events occur - for forecasts are not prophecies.If things turn out the way we expect them to, the German economy will grow considerably faster than the economy of most other euro-area countries. Nor are prospects brightening up for Germany alone. Most of the crisis countries, if they haven’t yet put recession behind them, can at least see the light at the end of the tunnel.Another positive factor is that the heterogeneity in the euro area as regards economic growth, which was still very pronounced in 2011, has declined significantly over the last two years. Going by the European Commission's 2013 autumn forecast, the growth disparities will continue to decrease substantially in the current year.Amongst other things, the fact that the differences in economic growth rates have narrowed further of late is proof of the success of the adjustment measures in the crisis countries. However, the individual countries still differ in terms of their position in the economic cycle.This represents a challenge for the Eurosystem, our common central banking system. This is because the ECB Governing Council, to which I belong as President of the Bundesbank, can only make one common monetary policy - for the entire euro area. In the deployment of our instruments we cannot make allowances for the economic situation of individual member countries. We knew that when we embarked upon monetary union, and that’s why, for example, there can only be one policy rate for the entire euro area.One consequence of divergences in the economic situation is the diversity of inflation rates in the euro-area countries. It is not surprising that consumer prices in Germany are rising somewhat more quickly than in the euro area as a whole. Nevertheless, according to our latest forecast, the German rate of inflation, too, will remain clearly below the 2 percent mark this and next year.The outlook for price developments in the euro area as a whole, which play a key part in determining actions taken by the ECBGoverning Council, will only gradually move in that direction again. And you know that the Governing Council defines price stability as an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2 percent. Eurosystem staff are expecting an inflation rate of 1.1 percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2015.The risks of a significantly higher rate of inflation in the medium term are therefore low at present. That applies to the entire euro area as well as to Germany. I am in complete agreement with my colleague, Mario Draghi, that there is no reason for irrational fears of inflation. That is not to say that combatting inflation will no longer be an issue in the future. I would recommend analysing things rationally and keeping an eye also on long-term dangers to price stability.But at the same time, in the current economic situation the risk that the euro area will experience broad-based deflation is also limited. This, too, is a spectre which, on sober reflection, vanishes in thin air.This is connected, not least, to the fact that long-term inflation expectations are solidly anchored at around 2 percent. Above all, however, we are on the threshold of a phase of economic recovery - which will gradually push inflation rates back up.The currently low inflation rates as an average for the euro area are the result, not least, of the adjustment measures undertaken by the crisis countries. These measures are unavoidable in order to make the economic structures more competitive and promote sounder public finances - in other words, for these countries to get back on their feet. Sustainable economic growth in the long term will not be possible with bloated construction or financial sectors.Advocates for an even more expansionary monetary and fiscal policy often cite the risk of a Japanese scenario, warning that the euro area faces a similar fate as the Japanese economy, which has suffered from the effects of a deflationary trend during the last two decades. But the situations differ greatly.First, the Japanese yen appreciated sharply at the beginning of the 1990s, with the result that receding import prices acted as a brake on the general price trend. The euro experienced no such strong appreciation during the crisis.Second, deflation requires that nominal wages fall, or at least expand at a slower pace than productivity, over a protracted period of time. In Japan, labour income per employee dropped considerably over many years, whereas no such board-based development is to be seen in the euro area. Only in Ireland and Greece has compensation per employee fallen markedly to sharply.Fear of a Japanese scenario is therefore misplaced.Moreover, the notion of Japan’s lost decades needs to be seen in perspective. The weakness of growth in Japan is partly a natural consequence of the country’s demographic change, as the working-age population has been shrinking since the mid-1990s. And that, by the way, is an economic policy challenge that awaits Germany in the years to come.A critical view therefore also needs to be taken of the discussion kicked off by former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and fuelled by Paul Krugman, about secular stagnation. Mr Summers recently warned that the US faced the risk of weak growth similar to that in Japan, and called for an even more expansionary demand policy. In so doing, however, he fails to see that the weak real growth in Japan is primarily a long-term structural problem that cannot be remedied in a sustainable manner by demand-oriented economic policy.The lesson to be learned from the example of Japan, however, is that the job of cleansing bank balance sheets of toxic assets should not be delayed.Those were my remarks about Japan. Let me come back to the euro area.A badly informed journal recently claimed that I was fighting against the policy of low interest rates. What it is true to say is that, for months, I have been repeatedly stressing that an expansionary monetary policy is appropriate at the moment given foreseeable subdued price developments and moderate economic growth in the euro area.Against that backdrop, the Governing Council of the ECB recently confirmed its expectation that interest rates will remain at their present very low level for some time to come or in fact be going down even further.Ladies and gentlemenI am not overlooking the fact that a critical view is being taken of the extremely low interest rates, especially in Germany. The most recent cut in the key interest rate in November caused considerable discontent in some quarters. Let me say something about this.I am very well able to understand the fact that German savers, as well as savers elsewhere, are annoyed when their savings accounts lose value in real terms because the rates of interest on low-risk investments are lower than the rate of inflation. That means the loss of a key incentive to accumulate savings.But please consider also that low interest rates are intended to give a boost to consumption and investment. That is the very reason why the central bank keeps them at a low level. Apart from that, what should be remembered in this context is that, for many people, including in Germany, low interest rates are not just a drawback.Homebuilders are benefiting from them when taking out a loan. Firms are enjoying favourable financing conditions, which is ultimately a good thing for employees, too. The government is paying less interest on its debt, which is bringing relief for taxpayers. Members of the general public are not just savers, they have other economic motives as well.Besides, it simply isn’t the task of the central bank to ensure a given minimum return on risk-free financial investments. Rather, I agree with Jean-Claude Trichet, who recently said in an interview that it was not the ECB’s mandate to aim for an interest rate that pleases everyone; the mandate of the ECB is to maintain price stability.For me, that is the crucial point in this debate: members of the general public should be able to rely on us fulfilling this mandate and not making it subordinate to other objectives. The Bundesbank stands by this unconditionally - no ifs, no buts.However, we must not turn a blind eye to the fact that extremely low interest rates also harbour risks to financial stability and the efficiency of economic structures. These, in turn, can have an impact on price developments and the central bank’s ability to achieve its primary objective of price stability. The crisis made this abundantly clear for us.An ultra-loose monetary policy is a course of treatment with risks and side effects. For that reason, it must not become a long-term therapy, especially as its positive effects decrease the longer the treatment continues, while the risks increase.There is a danger of economic agents  ?  such as households and, in particular, enterprises, but policymakers, too  ?  getting used to the ultra-loose monetary policy. Eventually, this might mean that a necessary structural change fails to take place or that enterprises without a sustainable business model are kept alive.But the low interest rate setting also has directly negative repercussions for banks, building and loan associations and insurance companies.In the case of banks, declining margins mean a deterioration in profitability. Banks whose earnings derive mainly from the interest rate differential between deposits and loans are hit especially hard by this, and that means not least savings banks and credit cooperatives. These institutions will find it an increasing problem in the long run to conduct risk provisioning for economically difficult times. And insurers as well, particularly life insurers, will have an increasingly hard time generating guaranteed returns, the longer low interest rates persist.At the same time, there is a risk that low interest rates will prompt investors to embark on a search for yield. An increasing risk propensity on the part of investors might lead to hazardous excesses in individual financial market segments and, as it were, sow the seeds of the next financial crisis.The hype surrounding the internet currency Bitcoin also has to be seen in this context. I say internet currency in inverted commas, as Bitcoins do not nearly fulfil the essential criteria for a currency and are more an object of speculation, the risks of which should be fully understood by investors.Over the long term, low interest rates can also encourage excessive behaviour in the housing market. In actual fact, house prices in Germany have been showing a marked rise since 2010, especially in urban centres. However, it is not yet possible to speak of a broadly based bubble. At the moment, price increases are concentrated on urban property markets. Real estate prices in fashionable downtown areas are not an indication of what is happening in the rest of the country. Still, it is a development we have to keep an eye on.Claudio Borio, currently Head of the Monetary and Economic Department at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  ?  in other words, the central banks’ bank  ?  says of ultra-loose monetary policy, in my view quite correctly, that The longer these policies and measures last, the worse the cost-benefit outcome will be.Monetary policymakers should therefore not only have an eye on the risks to price stability, which are indicated by the commonly used projection models, but also be aware of the fact that financial instability can also jeopardise price stability.The monetary pillar in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy attempts to identify longer-term risks to price stability, although modelling the link between money or loans, on the one hand, and the inflation rate, on the other, is anything but easy, especially in economically turbulent times.Monetary policy, however, is not the most effective instrument for responding to financial market crises. One major lesson of the crisis was that there were no instruments available to counter the looming, principally national financial market excesses in time. This gap is being closed by the macroprudential instruments.Ultimately, it is true to say that the causes of the crisis in the euro area cannot be eliminated with the resources of monetary policy. It is a matter for politicians to overcome the crisis permanently by strengthening the forces of growth and freeing monetary policy from its difficult position.More than 90 years ago, Will Rogers said, There have been three great inventions since the beginning of time: fire, thewheel, and central banking.It should be mentioned that Will Rogers was a humorist; his comment was probably not meant as a compliment to central banks. I get the impression a little bit that some politicians think central banks hold the key to solving all pressing economic problems.Not so long ago, Raghuram Rajan, former Chief Economist at the IMF and current Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, claimed that central bankers nowadays enjoy the popularity of rock stars.Even though I think that is an exaggeration, it is reflection of the expectations that are now placed in central banks. I view this with a certain amount of concern, since the transfer of more and more responsibility can jeopardise central banks’ independence. However, the experience of the 1970s and 1980s taught us that independence is a major prerequisite for central banks’ ability to fulfil their price stability mandate.What is true for others is also true for central banks - exceptional circumstances justify exceptional measures. But with a little prudence, please.In the face of the crisis, the Eurosystem rolled out far-reaching conventional and unconventional measures to prevent an escalation of the crisis. Many of these measures had my support.But it’s certainly no secret that I view some decisions with a critical eye. In my opinion, purchasing bonds from crisis countries risks blurring the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policy. That might hinder the central bank’s long-term capacity to perform its mandate of safeguarding price stability. Blurring policy boundaries in this manner undermines the fundamental framework of monetary union, which is founded on individual national responsibility and the principle of liability.It is undisputed in the ECB Governing Council that the Eurosystem’s crisis measures cannot replace either the adjustment measures that need to be implemented nationally or the essential reforms at the institutional level.The peripheral euro-area countries have made impressive progress in adjusting their economies in recent years, and their efforts to implement structural reforms are gradually bearing fruit.The peripheral countries have largely reduced their high current account deficits, and some are now running a surplus. Huge strides have been made in boosting price competitiveness, which is driving exports higher. Apart from Italy, the peripheral countries have seen their national unit labour costs diminish substantially. Structural budget deficits have contracted sharply.All in all, it is safe to say that the adjustment process is in full swing, with some countries being further advanced than others. A leading group of countries is already within sight of the finishing line, while others still have quite a way to go. The crisis is not yet over for any of the peripheral countries.The high levels of unemployment across many countries undoubtedly paint a gloomy picture. But the jobless figures at least appear to be levelling off, and they are already improving slightly in some countries.High levels of unemployment certainly owe something to the economic adjustment process. Yet the notion that the labour market would be better off without adjustment does not hold water. The reforms form the basis for the economic turnaround and thus for an upturn in employment as well.Incidentally, the improvement in the peripheral countries’ current account positions was mirrored by a drop in German surpluses with these countries. So it is misleading for Nobel Prize-winning US economist Paul Krugman to claim that Germany failed to make any adjustment at all; deficits in Spain, Greece and elsewhere shrank, but Germany’s surplus didn’t.Germany’s current account surplus of around 7 percent of GDP is still very high - that much is true. But these surpluses are now being generated predominantly outside the euro area. The current account surplus with other euro-area countries, meanwhile, is down by half compared to 2007.So Germany is very much playing a role in rectifying imbalances across the euro area. But spurring domestic demand in Germany - something which has been called for on numerous occasions, most recently by the US Treasury Secretary last week here in Berlin - would be of no great benefit, given the minimal impact it would have on the peripheral countries. That applies to credit-financed spending programmes and an expansionary wage policy in equal measure.Running a policy at the expense of fiscal credibility would endanger Germany’s role as an anchor of stability in the monetary union, and would thus even yield a counterproductive outcome. And as for higher wages, Bundesbank calculations indicate that raising wages by two percentage points above the level justified by improved labour productivity, for example, would indeed trigger an expansionary effect on demand to begin with. Over the longer term, however, this would mostly act as a drag on German enterprises’ competitiveness, particularly benefiting competitors outside the euro area such as China and the United States. At the end of the day, our European partners would probably be worse off.So it cannot be a matter of merely redistributing economic competitiveness throughout the euro area. It is the competitiveness of the euro area as a whole which needs to be stepped up.If the monetary union is to be placed on a sound long-term basis, the adjustment measures in the problem countries are a necessary condition but not a sufficient one. Only by restoring a harmonious balance in the institutional framework of monetary union will the euro area be able to put the crisis firmly behind it.In its current configuration, the operational framework is somewhat skewed. The fiscal assistance measures have put elements of mutualised liability in place, but the attendant powers of intervention have not been granted to the community.What this means is that the relationship between liability and control has got out of kilter. And when that happens, there is a risk that prudent decision-making will go out of the window. This is a lesson which the financial crisis has taught us. As a case in point, banks could long rely on being bailed out with taxpayers’ money if they ran into difficulties.If we are to maintain the balance between control and liability, we essentially need to opt for one of two paths towards a more stable monetary union framework. Either we proceed towards deeper political integration - a fiscal union, say - or we develop the existing framework further and bolster the individual national responsibility of the individual member states as a constitutive feature of monetary union.However, a fiscal union must not simply mean extending mutualised liability, because that would merely be a transfer union. A fiscal union that is worthy of the name would instead require member states to transfer national sovereignty to the community level, say by giving the community the necessary right to intervene in the event of unsound public finances.Blending mutualised liability with decentralised decision-making powers on debt would be the wrong way forward. Policymakers might see this as an attractive quick fix for the crisis, but it is anything but a sustainable configuration for a monetary union. In fact, it provides an additional incentive for member states to run up debt without providing any effective control instruments. So anyone can get into debt at someone else’s expense.As I just mentioned, only two options are sustainable. Returning to the founding principles of the Maastricht Treaty, or evolving into a fiscal union.The debate on choosing the right path towards a more stable monetary union - one which takes the people’s concerns seriously - is an important one. Nor is it a debate which fuels anti-European sentiment, but one which lays the groundwork for popular acceptance and approval. Because I’m convinced that the people will ultimately only accept a union that is built on stability.At the end of the day, far-reaching political decisions will need to be taken, no matter which path we choose. For instance, a credible no bail-out regime would need to be backed by a codified insolvency regime for member states which can be implemented without jeopardising the financial stability of the community as a whole.For example, three years ago, the Bundesbank proposed reforming the standardised terms and conditions for sovereign debt with the aim of strengthening investors’ individual responsibility, limiting the total liability for countries providing assistance and winning time for structural reforms. The Bundesbank suggested that a clause should be hard-wired into the terms and conditions for the issuance of euro-area government bonds that would automatically extend the maturity of a given country's bonds by three years if that country received loans from the ESM fund.Automatically extending bond maturities in this manner would buy time for crisis countries to resolve their problems without private creditors withdrawing their capital. Thus, it would massively reduce the funding which the ESM would have to provide - and which the taxpayers of other member states would have to guarantee - to the level of net new borrowing. It would buy time to gauge, with a higher degree of certainty, whether the country in question was experiencing solvency or liquidity problems. This would allow a better balance to be struck between liability and control. Now some might say that we have indeed strengthened centralised control mechanisms, and that this would permit at least a degree of mutualised liability. But we should be under no illusions. It is true that Brussels has been given greater powers to police member states’ debt policies - by way of the reinforced Stability and Growth Pact, Fiscal Compact, European Semester etc - but when push comes to shove, member states still insist that they, and they alone, have the final say.Time will tell whether the new rules will have the desired binding effect. If anything, things have become more complex and less transparent, opening up scope for interpretation. The first cases in which the new rules have been applied suggest that this scope is being used rather generously.This shows that the willingness to cede fiscal policy powers to Europe on the part of policymakers and the public at large in the member states simply isn’t strong enough to take the step towards greater integration and a bona fide fiscal union. All the more so, given that this would also necessitate far-reaching constitutional amendments in the member states.So from a fiscal policy perspective, it looks as if toughening up the existing Maastricht framework is the more realistic way forward. In the long run, only a coherent operational framework can reliably ensure that the monetary union is a union of stability.And maintaining a stability union is also fundamentally important for the single monetary policy. Otherwise, it might prove permanently ever more difficult for the Eurosystem to fulfil its mandate, particularly if it is increasingly being forced to act as the lender of last resort for governments.That’s why it’s all the more important for the Eurosystem to eliminate any doubts that the central bank’s task is to safeguard price stability. At the same time, sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for price stability which the Eurosystem itself cannot bring about. This is where the onus is on governments and parliaments.Allow me to touch on one last point: the European banking union.The crisis has made it abundantly clear that the vulnerability of the financial and banking system is a key weakness of the euro area. It must be rendered more resilient and safer. This is where the banking union will make an important contribution.The banking union incorporates a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) as well as a single resolution mechanism.Banking supervision is to be based at the ECB and will be launched in the autumn of this year. From a human resources perspective alone, this project is a Herculean task. Some 1,000 new staff will have to be recruited over the course of the year. However, it is also a major challenge to ensure that all banks in the euro area will, in future, be supervised according to the same high standards.Before the launch of the single supervisor, a comprehensive balance sheet assessment will be conducted for the 128 significant banks that will, in future, be supervised directly by the ECB. If this assessment reveals that recapitalisation is needed, this is to be remedied before the launch of the SSM, primarily using private funds. Or, if that is not possible and the bank has a sustainable business model, by the respective government. Ultimately, it is a question of who is responsible for past failings in banking supervision - and that was the individual member states.The second pillar of the banking union is the single resolution mechanism to deal with future bank failures, on which the member states reached a basic agreement shortly before Christmas. For European banking supervision also requires European banking resolution; otherwise, control and liability would diverge. Where a bank fails, resolution costs must, as a general rule, in the future be borne first by shareholders and creditors. After that, a bank-financed resolution fund is to come into play, and only as a last resort are public funds to be used and the taxpayer made to pay.The fund is to be built up over a period of ten years and reach a volume of €55 billion. Before the fund is fully capitalised, bank resolutions would be financed out of national compartments, which we welcome in the interests of a balance between liability and control.In the long term, Europeanisation of liability with a centralised supervisor is appropriate. However, as long as other factors with a key impact on the quality of bank balance sheets remain under national control - for instance tax legislation, insolvency rules or economic policy - it makes sense for some liability to stay at the national level.The same argument can also be applied to giving precedence to the use of national tax funds for a transitional period.The banking union makes a key contribution to financial stability and to strengthening the institutional framework of the monetary union. Another essential prerequisite for a more stable monetary union is, however, stricter financial market regulation.More has been initiated in this area than is generally acknowledged. At the beginning of this year, the Basel III capital rules became effective in Europe, which will gradually improve the quantity and quality of banks’ capital. Moreover, rating agencies have been placed under supervision, inappropriate compensation systems have been corrected, computer-driven high-frequency trading subjected to stricter regulation and trade in highly speculative financial derivatives has been rendered more transparent and thus safer.In order to break the disastrous nexus of banks and governments, the regulatory treatment of government bonds will, however, also have to be changed.Currently, banks can invest unlimited amounts in euro-area government bonds. Under the current capital rules, a zero risk weight applies to these assets, which means that these government bonds can be fully funded with borrowed money, in other words, they do not require any capital backing. This constitutes preferential treatment, and has been a factor in banks in several peripheral euro-area states, in particular, raising their exposure to domestic sovereign bonds during the crisis; they have thereby tied their fate to that of their national government.In my opinion, credit ceilings and risk-based capital backing would be a sensible way of breaking the nexus - that would basically mean applying similar rules to those for bank loans to private-sector debtors. Such rules would also promote bank lending to enterprises.Support for this proposal is growing, its logic is compelling, but implementation is probably not on the cards for 2014, and I fear that Berlin Brandenburg Airport may be up and running first. In the longer term, however, such regulations are, in my opinion, an indispensable prerequisite for a stable monetary union and a healthy financial system.Ladies and gentlemen Considerable progress has already been made towards resolving the crisis, but there is still a long way to go. The aim must be a more stable financial system and a more crisis-resistant monetary union.Important strategic decisions will again have to be taken in 2014, and it remains to be hoped that far-sighted agreements will be reached. Financial market regulation remains on the agenda, as do further structural reforms in the peripheral countries. In Germany, politicians should be careful not to jeopardise the achievements of the reform policies. The good state of the German economy can be attributed, in good part, to the structural reforms of the past decade.Institutional reform of the monetary union must continue apace, with the objective of establishing stable long-term foundations. And in terms of monetary policy decisions, the needle of the compass should point clearly in the direction of long-term price stability; the risks associated with the current policy must be taken into consideration; the central banks must not be overburdened.Every issue of the Tagesspiegel features the motto rerum cognoscere causas on the front page.

"2014-01-16 - BuBa - Joachim Nagel.txt","ich freue mich sehr, heute hier in Hohenheim bei der Vortragsreihe der Stiftung Kreditwirtschaft zu Ihnen sprechen zu können. Wie Sie alle wissen, sollte heute Frau Lautenschläger, die für Bankenaufsicht zuständige Vize-Präsidentin der Bundesbank, zu Ihnen sprechen. Durch ihre anstehende Berufung in das EZB-Direktorium, war es ihr nun leider nicht möglich heute nach Hohenheim zu kommen. Als ihr Vertreter für Fragen der Bankenaufsicht im Vorstand der Deutschen Bundesbank, darf ich Ihnen daher heute einen Überblick zum aktuellen Stand der Europäischen Bankenunion geben.Sie sehen, von uns allen wird Flexibilität verlangt. Und Flexibilität ist auch das richtige Stichwort für die Europäische Bankenunion. Es geht um eine Veränderung, der wir uns stellen müssen und die natürlich für alle auch eine große Herausforderung darstellt. Die Bankenunion ist vor ca. eineinhalb Jahren von den EU-Staats- und Regierungschefs beschlossen worden. Zu ihren zwei zentralen Säulen möchte ich Sie heute Abend hier in Hohenheim auf den aktuellsten Stand bringen: Einerseits die bei der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) angesiedelte europäische Bankenaufsicht und andererseits den europäischen Abwicklungsmechanismus.Vor zwei Monaten, am 3. November vergangenen Jahres, trat die EU-Verordnung in Kraft, die die erste Säule der Bankenunion errichtet, den einheitlichen Aufsichtsmechanismus in Europa. Der so genannte Single Supervisory Mechanism oder kurz SSM. Damit ist der 4. November 2014 der früheste Termin, an dem die EZB die Verantwortung für die Bankenaufsicht übernehmen kann.Und diese Verantwortung hat es in sich. Die EZB wird die 128 größten Banken des Euroraums direkt beaufsichtigen; das entspricht 85 Prozent der über alle Banken aggregierten Bilanzsumme. Und sie wird für die restlichen gut 4000 Banken die aufsichtlichen Rahmenbedingungen festlegen, also beispielsweise Leitlinien erlassen und auf eine Harmonisierung der Aufsichtspraxis drängen.Die Arbeiten an dem einheitlichen Aufsichtsmechanismus treten nun in die heiße Phase; heiß, weil der SSM jetzt nach außen sichtbar werden wird. Die neue Aufsicht nimmt für die Öffentlichkeit nach und nach Gestalt an, sowohl inhaltlich als auch personell.Am 2. Januar hat Daniele Nouy, die Vorsitzende des Supervisory Board, ihre Arbeit aufgenommen. Das Supervisory Board wird alle wichtigen bankaufsichtlichen Fragestellungen behandeln. Am 30. Januar wird die erste offizielle Sitzung des Supervisory Board stattfinden.Das Board wird an die bereits geleistete Arbeit anknüpfen – und die Ergebnisse der Vorarbeiten des Jahres 2013 können sich sehen lassen. Denn die Arbeiten an der ersten Säule der Bankenunion laufen schon eine ganze Weile auf Hochtouren. Das informelle Vorläufergremium des Supervisory Boards trifft sich seit Monaten regelmäßig alle zwei bis drei Wochen, um einen möglichst reibungslosen Start des einheitlichen Aufsichtsmechanismus vorzubereiten.Und man ist gut vorangekommen. Nach intensiver Diskussion einigte man sich auf einen Vorschlag, der die Grundlagen der neuen europäischen Aufsicht darstellen könnte. Nun müssen zunächst der Supervisory Board und danach der EZB-Rat diesen grundsätzlichen Überlegungen über Aufgabenteilung und Aufsichtsansatz zustimmen; und dann beginnt die öffentliche Konsultation.Bevor ich aber auf diese beiden wichtigen Punkte, Aufgabenteilung und Aufsichtsansatz, eingehe, lassen Sie mich kurz noch einige andere Themen auflisten, die das Vorgängergremium beschäftigten. So kann ich Ihnen einen kleinen Eindruck davon vermitteln, was alles zu einer europäischen Aufsicht gehört.   Um auswählen zu können, welche Kreditinstitute des Euroraumes unter die Aufsicht des SSM fallen, verschaffte sich das Vorläufergremium im vergangenen Jahr unter anderem einen Überblick über die wesentlichen Bilanzkennziffern und gesellschaftsrechtlichen Strukturen dieser Banken. Das hört sich trivial an. Es war aber tatsächlich keine einfache Aufgabe, denn es ging darum, die Banken des Euroraums nach einheitlichen Kriterien zu beurteilen; und es zeigten sich deutlich die Unterschiede in den nationalen Bilanzierungs- und Konsolidierungsregimen der 18 Mitgliedsländer. Das war das erste, und bestimmt nicht das letzte Mal, dass wir mit diesen Unterschieden in den nationalen Rechtsgrundlagen, die weiterhin einen großen Einfluss auf die Banken haben werden, zu kämpfen hatten.Im letzten Jahr wurde schon erfasst, wie die 18 Mitgliedstaaten nationale Wahlrechte in den aufsichtlichen Rechtsgrundlagen nutzen. Zwangsläufig wird sich der SSM die Frage stellen müssen, ob diese immer im Einklang mit der Idee des gemeinsamen Binnenmarktes stehen.Ebenso wichtig ist die künftige Zusammenarbeit mit den Aufsichtsbehörden von Drittländern; auch hierzu gibt es bereits ein erstes Konzept.Und zu guter Letzt war das Vorgängergremium auch in die Arbeiten rund um den Gesundheitscheck der signifikanten Banken, das Comprehensive Assessment, eingebunden.Aber nun, wie angekündigt, zu dem gemeinsamen Aufsichtsansatz oder eine – für alle Teilnehmer am SSM bzw. die Öffentlichkeit eindeutigen – Aufgabenteilung zwischen EZB und nationalen Aufsichtsbehörden.  Eine Rahmenverordnung wird die praktische Zusammenarbeit und die Arbeitsabläufe innerhalb des SSM regeln; dabei geht es beispielsweise um den Informationsaustausch und die Arbeitsteilung zwischen EZB und nationaler Aufsicht oder die Methodologie zur Identifizierung der rund 130 signifikanten Kreditinstitute, die direkt von der EZB beaufsichtigt werden. Für die Beaufsichtigung dieser Institute – darunter 24 deutsche – werden sogenannte Joint Supervisory Teams (JST) gebildet, die aus Mitarbeitern der EZB und den nationalen Aufsichtsbehörden bestehen.Für mich stellen die JST das Herz der neuen Aufsicht dar. EZB-Mitarbeiter und Aufseher aus verschiedenen Mitgliedsstaaten werden im Team eine Bank beaufsichtigen. Ein EZB-Mitarbeiter oder eine EZB-Mitarbeiterin wird das Sagen haben; die nationalen Aufseher werden die Erfahrungen über diese spezielle Bank und Kenntnisse über die nationalen Rechtsgrundlagen und Marktstrukturen mitbringen. Daran lässt sich bereits erkennen, dass der nationale Aufseher nicht überflüssig wird. Im Gegenteil: Ohne ihn wird es – wie bisher – in vielen Fällen schlicht nicht gehen.Ein weiteres Beispiel dafür ist das in der Rahmenverordnung beschriebene Sprachenregime des SSM. Die Aufsicht über die kleineren und mittleren Banken wird weiterhin in nationaler Sprache stattfinden. Anders verhält es sich mit den direkt von der EZB beaufsichtigten Banken: Da die Arbeitssprache der EZBEnglisch ist, werden auch die dort arbeitenden Aufseher untereinander englisch kommunizieren. Gleiches strebt die EZBauch für ihre Banken an, auch wenn diese das Recht haben, im Schriftverkehr mit der EZB ihre nationale Sprache zu nutzen. Aber man muss auch immer realistisch bleiben: selbst wenn die Banken guten Willen zeigen, werden sehr viele Informationen wie Kreditakten in der jeweilige Landessprache vorgehalten. Auch hier braucht man den nationalen Aufseher, da nur er in der Lage ist, diese Informationen vernünftig auszuwerten. Damit werden aber keine neuen Probleme geschaffen, da sich Aufseher über international tätige Banken schon jetzt sehr eng austauschen müssen.Was ist vom neuen Aufsichtsmechanismus noch zu erwarten?Die Aufseher der EZB werden die Konvergenz in der Aufsichtspraxis in Europa vorantreiben. Sie werden beispielsweise über nun mögliche Quervergleiche über Ländergrenzen hinweg besser einschätzen können, ob Governance und Risikomanagement einer Bank den höchsten Standards entsprechen. Für die gut 4000 Banken, die zu der Gruppe der kleineren bzw.mittelgroßen Institute gehören, setzt die EZB dagegen nur den Rahmen der Aufsichtstätigkeit. Die eigentliche Aufsicht wird weiterhin von den nationalen Behörden ausgeübt.Bei dem zweiten wesentlichen Dokument handelt es sich um das Aufsichtshandbuch oder Supervisory Manual. Trocken beschrieben definiert es Vorgehen, Prozesse und Methodik für die Aufsicht signifikanter und nicht-signifikanter Institute. Hinter diesen eher etwas trockenen Begrifflichkeiten versteckt sich die Beschreibung des eigentlichen Kerns aufsichtlichen Tuns. Hier wird genau festgelegt, wie die Risiken in Banken quantitativ wie auch qualitativ bewertet werden; und das ist entscheidend für das spätere aufsichtliche Handeln – beginnend mit der Intensität der aufsichtlichen Begleitung bis hin zur Anordnung bankaufsichtlicher Maßnahmen wie etwa Kapitalzuschläge oder die Anpassungen bankinternen Risikomanagement-Prozesse an aufsichtliche Vorstellungen.Sie sehen: Alle Beteiligten waren fleißig. Aber es wurden bisher nicht nur viele Seiten Papier beschrieben, auch die praktische Arbeit läuft bereits: Das größte Vorbereitungsprojekt mit entsprechender Außenwirkung ist der derzeit laufende Gesundheitscheck, das so genannte dreistufige Comprehensive Assessment, der signifikanten Banken.Dessen Ziel ist es, Altlasten zu identifizieren und zu bereinigen, um der neuen Aufsicht unter dem Dach der EZB einen reibungslosen Start zu ermöglichen – mit möglichst sauberen Bilanzen der direkt beaufsichtigten Institute. Dies hat den sinnvollen Nebeneffekt, dass sich die EZB einen eigenen Überblick über die Kapital- und Risikolage sowie Governance- sowie Risikomanagementstrukturen der signifikanten Banken verschaffen kann, bevor die Verantwortung für die Aufsicht auf sie übergeht. Sie kann diese Erkenntnisse auch für die Fein-Konzeptionierung ihres Aufsichtsansatzes nutzen, da sie bei der umfassenden Bilanzüberprüfung mit einer Vielzahl von unterschiedlichen aufsichtlichen Anwendungspraktiken, von unterschiedlichen nationale Rechtsgrundlagen und unterschiedlich umgesetzten nationalen Wahlrechten konfrontiert sein wird.In den darauffolgenden Jahren wird sich dann immer wieder die Frage stellen, ob all die vorgefundenen Unterschiede gerechtfertigt sind. Ein Level Playing Field, also gleiche Rahmenbedingungen für alle Banken, ist nicht nur wichtig, um faire Wettbewerbsbedingungen zu schaffen, sondern auch um Regulierungsarbitrage und die daraus entstehenden Gefahren zu verhindern. Aber Sie kennen auch den Grundsatz: Gleiches ist zwar gleich, aber Ungleiches ist eben auch ungleich zu behandeln.Deswegen möchte ich auch auf die Unterschiede in den nationalen Marktstrukturen und in den Bedürfnissen der Realwirtschaft hinweisen – auch wenn hier und da zwar das eine oder andere nationale Wahlrecht überstrapaziert worden sein mag. Es wird eine  Herausforderung werden, einen einheitlichen Rahmen für die europäischen Banken zu schaffen, der – gerechtfertigten – nationalen Besonderheiten wie etwa unterschiedlichen Marktstrukturen oder Rechtssystemen Rechnung trägt.Wie dem auch sei: Durch den SSM wird die Aufsichtspraxis zunächst im Euroraum konvergieren, und nationale Aufsichtsspielräume werden auf den Prüfstand kommen.Der einheitliche Abwicklungsmechanismus – oder SRM für Single Resolution Mechanism – ist die zweite tragende Säule der Bankenunion. Europäische Bankenaufsicht und europäische Bankenabwicklung sind zwei Seiten einer Medaille. Wenn also die EZB künftig europäische Banken beaufsichtigt, sollte auch ein europäisches Gremium über deren Abwicklung bestimmen. Das sieht die im Dezember beschlossene allgemeine Ausrichtung des ECOFIN mit der Errichtung eines europäischen Abwicklungsgremiums (Single Resolution Board, SRB) auch vor.Welche Banken fallen nun unter das europäische Abwicklungsregime? Der einheitliche Abwicklungsmechanismus soll nur auf SSM-Banken Anwendung finden und auf solche, die Auslandstöchter haben. Die Abwicklung der kleineren Institute wird künftig zwar auch europäisch geregelt, aber die Zuständigkeiten verbleiben auf nationaler Ebene. Das halte ich für richtig, da die Abwicklung einer kleinen Bank, einer kleinen Sparkasse oder Genossenschaftsbank, erstens nicht Auswirkungen auf europäischer Ebene nach sich ziehen wird, und zweitens diese Institute eher nicht in den Genuss der Mittel des europäischen Abwicklungsfonds kommen werden. Deshalb sollten solche Institute auch nicht mit denselben Maßstäben behandelt werden wie eine global agierende Bank.Wie sieht aber nun ein ideales Abwicklungsregime aus? Erstens müssen im Fall der Fälle die Verluste auch tatsächlich dort anfallen, wo sie hingehören, nämlich bei den Investoren. Zweitens muss das Abwicklungsregime die geordnete Abwicklung eines Instituts ermöglichen, das heißt, die Abwicklung darf keine unkontrollierbaren Auswirkungen auf das Finanzsystem haben. Dazu muss es auch möglich sein, innerhalb eines Wochenendes zu entscheiden, ob und wie abgewickelt wird. Nur mit schnellen Entscheidungsprozessen und kurzen Wegen ist es überhaupt möglich, dass jede Bank abgewickelt werden kann. Marktteilnehmer werden dieses Risiko als Aufschlag bei ihren Investitionen in Banken adäquat einpreisen – so wie sie es auch bei jeder anderen Investition tun.Man sollte erwarten, dass ein solches, auf die Besonderheiten von Banken abgestimmtes Abwicklungsregime wenig strittig sein dürfte. Warum ist die Abwicklung von Banken aber dann ein so heikles Thema? Wie so oft geht um die alles entscheidende Frage: Wer zahlt?Bei der Antwort auf diese Frage muss meines Erachtens eine Prämisse berücksichtigt werden: Um vernünftige Anreizstrukturen für Marktteilnehmer und Mitgliedstaaten zu setzen, bedarf es eines Gleichlaufs von Haftung und Kontrolle, das heißt wer vorab steuern und gestalten konnte, muss später auch haften. Dieses Prinzip hat bei einem europäischen Abwicklungsregime zwei Dimensionen: Einerseits das Verhältnis des Privatsektors zum öffentlichen Sektor sowie andererseits das Verhältnis der nationalen zur europäischen Ebene.Lassen Sie mich zuerst auf das Verhältnis des Privatsektors zum öffentlichen Sektor eingehen. Die Finanzkrise offenbarte, dass teilweise Geschäftsmodelle von Banken sich als nicht dauerhaft tragfähig erwiesen haben und zu hohen Verlusten führten, die vielfach vom Steuerzahler getragen werden mussten. Dies war nur vor dem Hintergrund der Kosten des Nichteingreifens begründbar. Es sollte in Zukunft aber weitestgehend ausgeschlossen werden. Etwaige Verluste müssen in erster Linie von Anteilseignern und Fremdkapitalgebern der Institute getragen werden. Dann stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit auch Einleger, natürlich oberhalb der Sicherungsgrenzen, heranzuziehen sind. Der Steuerzahler sollte idealerweise nicht betroffen sein. Es ist ein Meilenstein und dennoch nach meinem Verständnis eigentlich eine Selbstverständlichkeit, dass der im Dezember beschlossene Kompromiss im Rat auf dem Grundsatz aufbaut, dass beim Scheitern einer Bank primär der Privatsektor herangezogen werden soll; das heißt, es sollen erst die Anteilseigner und Gläubiger die Verluste tragen, ehe externe Mittel eingesetzt werden.Allerdings müssen Auswirkungen auf das Finanzsystem als Ganzes berücksichtigt werden und somit sind Ausnahmen von diesem Grundsatz vorgesehen. Im Interesse der Finanzstabilität können bereits vor einem vollständigem Bail-In Abwicklungsfonds oder sogar Steuergelder eingesetzt werden. Um dem Prinzip des Gleichlaufs von Haftung und Kontrolle zu entsprechen, finde ich es sehr wichtig, dafür zu sorgen, dass solche Mittel wirklich nur im Ausnahmefall genutzt werden. Es muss bei einer klaren Haftungsabfolge bleiben, auch in der tatsächlichen Umsetzung der Regeln. Ausnahmefälle dürfen in keinem Fall zur Regel werden. Ansonsten wird es Investoren schwer fallen, das mit dem Kapital- und Schuldinstrumenten verbundene Risiko richtig zu bepreisen. Auch erhöhen Ausnahmeregeln die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass am Ende doch Steuergelder verwendet werden.  Um das zu vermeiden, sieht die allgemeine Ausrichtung nach einem Bail-In auch zu Recht als nächste Verteidigungslinie nicht die Allgemeinheit, sondern einen Abwicklungsfonds vor, der von Bankenabgaben gespeist wird. Der europäische Abwicklungsfonds soll in Zukunft 55 Milliarden Euro umfassen.Um aber auch innerhalb des Bankensektors die Anreize richtig zu setzen und Moral Hazard zu bekämpfen, sollten sich auch die Beiträge für den Abwicklungsfonds am Risiko der Bank orientieren, damit konservativ arbeitende Kreditinstitute nicht bestraft werden. Der Kompromisstext spricht hier von risikogerechten Prämien.Ebenso begrüßen wir es, dass die nationalen Abwicklungsfonds graduell über zehn Jahre hinweg in einen nicht mehr weiter national differenzierten europäischen Fonds überführt werden; allerdings müssen hier noch die Einzelheiten in einem Abkommen der Mitgliedstaaten geregelt werden.Mit den neuem Regime entstehen der Allgemeinheit idealerweise keine Kosten bei der Abwicklung einer Bank. Doch was passiert in der Übergangsphase, wenn während der Aufbauphase der Abwicklungsfonds nach dem Bail-In größere Mittel für die Abwicklung benötigt? Auch für diesen Fall muss es einen Plan B geben. Sollten dann öffentliche Mittel nötig werden, dann würde sich der Abwicklungsfonds diese Mittel im Gegensatz zu einem echten Bail-Out nur leihen. Zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt müsste er sie zurückzahlen.Mit dem Bereitstellung öffentlicher Mittel kommen wir zur zweiten Dimension: das Verhältnis der nationalen zur europäischen Ebene.Auch hier gilt meines Erachtens der Grundsatz, dass sich Gestaltungs- bzw. Handlungsmöglichkeiten und Haftung im Einklang befinden müssen. Mit dem einheitlichen Aufsichtsmechanismus werden Handlungs- und Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten auf europäischer Ebene liegen. Die Zukunft gehört dem SSM; er tritt aber auch das Erbe der nationalen Aufseher an. Deren Aufsicht hat die Banken geprägt – im Guten wie im Schlechten; und es wird Jahre dauern, bis so unterschiedliche Dinge wie das Bestandsgeschäft oder die Governance- und Risikomanagementstrukturen der einzelnen Banken den Stempel der europäischen Aufsicht tragen.Ein Haftungskonzept, das einen Teil der Haftung zunächst auf nationaler Ebene belässt und über die Zeit einen größeren Anteil an Haftungsmasse auf die europäische Ebene überträgt, berücksichtigt diese Gegebenheiten meiner Einschätzung nach zu Recht.Alles in allem halte ich also die vom EU-Rat kürzlich beschlossene allgemeine Ausrichtung für gelungen. Ich hoffe, dass die SRM-Verordnung wie geplant im April finalisiert wird. Und ich hoffe des Weiteren, dass die SRM-Verordnung nicht erst im Jahr 2018, sondern früher in Kraft tritt, damit die europäische Aufsicht möglichst bald durch die europäische Abwicklung ergänzt wird.Sie sehen, es verändert sich viel – und zwar im raschen Tempo. Um wieder an den Anfang zurückzukommen: Das Mammutprojekt verlangt Flexibilität.

"2014-01-21 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","HThe story goes that at some point in history the kingdom of Phrygia was without a king. The priests therefore consulted an oracle to determine who should fill the vacant position. The oracle decreed that the next man to enter the city in an ox cart should become the new king. That man was Gordias, a peasant.Gordias became the king of Phrygia and, out of gratitude, his son dedicated the ox cart to the gods. The gods in turn tied the cart to a pole with a complicated knot - the famous Gordian Knot. This knot was so complex that for centuries no one was able to untie it. Hence, the cart was still tied to its pole when Alexander the Great entered the scene in 400 BC.Meanwhile, it had been prophesied that whoever untied the knot would become king of Asia. Alexander, full of ambition, took on the challenge. Unable to find the loose end of the knot, he drew his sword and sliced the knot in two, thereby undoing it. Since then, the Gordian Knot has become a symbol for solving seemingly insoluble problems by thinking outside the box and then taking bold action.The insoluble problem in our case is how to secure financial stability. And after six years of crisis, more and more people are, understandably, looking for a Gordian solution. To some, the solution would be to break up the banks - with one bold stroke of the sword, as it were. Broadly speaking, the dividing line would run between those parts of a bank engaged in commercial banking and those parts engaged in investment banking.In my speech today, I will address the question of whether this is a sensible approach. As I speak first at this conference, my objective is to give an overview of the issue, discuss the pros and cons of the proposal and try to draw a tentative conclusion. Let us begin by looking at the arguments put forward by the proponents of breaking up the banks.The underlying notion is, of course, that there are two different worlds. There is the world of commercial banking, which is populated by conservative and “prudent” bankers who support the real economy and provide a haven for savings. And then there is the world of investment banking populated by the Gordon Gekkos of this world, who pose a constant risk to financial stability and to taxpayers’ money.The combination of these two worlds in a universal bank is seen as a source of systemic risk. It is therefore being proposed that they be separated: instead of universal banks there would just be pure commercial and pure investment banks. But why is the combination of commercial and investment banking perceived as a source of systemic risk? And what specifically are the objectives of those who want to separate them?The general objective when breaking up the banks is to shield those parts that are deemed vital for the real economy from those parts which have little or no connection to the real economy - to shield commercial banking from investment banking. The underlying assumption is that investment banking is risky and thus more prone to losses and failure.If the investment banking branch of a universal bank were to fail, it would drag the commercial banking branch down with it. Both parts would go down together, disrupting the real economy. It is therefore argued that separating the two parts would block this channel of contagion, shield the real economy and protect savers and taxpayers alike.But there is more to the argument. Two aspects are usually emphasised. The first aspect is the existence of deposit insurance schemes. These schemes render deposits risk-free - at least up to a certain amount. Consequently, depositors demand lower risk premiums. This holds even if the bank in question is engaged in risky investment banking activities. Universal banks can therefore draw on a subsidised source of funds to finance their investment banking activities. It is argued that separating commercial and investment banking would abolish this subsidy, align incentives for investment banks and force them to reduce the size of their business.The second aspect is the existence of implicit government guarantees for certain banks. If a large and interconnected universal bank fails, the whole financial system might be disrupted, as might the real economy. The taxpayer might therefore be forced to step in and save the bank to prevent an even worse outcome. Banks that enjoy such a status are termed too big to fail or too interconnected to fail. Just like deposit insurance, such an implicit government guarantee subsidises investment banking activities.Proponents of breaking up the banks argue that pure investment banks with no connection to the real economy would be treated differently. They would be excluded from deposit insurance schemes and also from implicit government guarantees. Consequently, if things went wrong, they would not be rescued by the government at the taxpayers’ expense - moral hazard would be reduced. Moreover, banks would become less complex and thereby easier to resolve.These are - in a nutshell - the central arguments brought forward by the proponents of breaking up the banks. They claim that breaking up the banks would block channels of contagion, would remove subsidies for risky investment banking, would lower the risk of systemic crises, would make banks easier to resolve and would eventually save taxpayers’ money.Now, could one stroke of the sword really take us all the way to financial stability? To answer this question, we have to take a step back. To me, financial stability cannot be achieved as long as banks are too big, too interconnected or too complex to fail. Finding a solution to this problem would eliminate implicit government guarantees, would align incentives and would increase financial stability.What we need at a very basic conceptual level are two lines of defence. First, we have to make banks safer to reduce the likelihood of failure. Second, if a bank fails, it must be able to do so without disrupting the entire financial system. Erecting these two lines of defence is the basic challenge we are facing. And at the same time, it should be the benchmark for evaluating the benefits of breaking up the banks.The first question is therefore: would breaking up the banks make them safer? It is true that commercial banking would benefit if it had some degree of insulation from the perils of investment banking. But is commercial banking in itself really safer than investment banking? Looking back, we have to admit that pure commercial banks were at the centre of the recent crisis: Washington Mutual, Countrywide, Hypo Real Estate and the Spanish savings banks, to name just a few. The question of stability ultimately depends on the sustainability of the business model. And a commercial bank that is highly leveraged and has an unsustainable business model can be as risky as any investment bank. In addition, breaking up the banks would reduce their potential to diversify. This, in turn, could increase their exposure to individual shocks - they might even become less safe.The second question is: would breaking up the banks limit the size of investment banks by removing funding subsidies? Well, it certainly would remove at least those subsidies related to deposit insurance. But there are two things we should bear in mind. First, if deprived of deposits as a source of funding, an increasing number of pure investment banks would have to revert to less stable sources of funding - they would become less safe. Second, what about that part of the subsidy that is due to implicit government guarantees? This point relates to our second line of defence - to the question of whether a bank can fail without disrupting the whole system.And frankly, I am not fully convinced that breaking up the banks would block the relevant channels of contagion. True, it would block channels of contagion within banks. But wouldn’t they just be replaced by channels of contagion between banks? I think that even after breaking up the banks, the financial system would be characterised by a large degree of interconnectedness. And again, we could take a look into history. Lehman Brothers was a pure investment bank, yet when it failed in 2008 it brought the financial system to the brink of collapse - because it was so interconnected.Against this backdrop, the question is: what would happen if another pure investment bank were to fail? Would the government really just stand on the side-lines and watch the potential fallout? Or would it be compelled to step in, as it has done before, to save the failing bank - regardless of whether it is attached to a commercial bank or not?And what about the problem of shadow banking? I see the danger that breaking up the banks might provide incentives to export more and more risky activities to the realm of non-bank banking. However, the risks could easily be re-imported to the regular banking system. In the end, we would have gained nothing. This is why our efforts to control the shadow banking system have to continue.Regarding the proposal to break up the banks, a lot of questions on the effects and side-effects remain unanswered. And this takes me directly to the last issue I wish to raise. We all know that the worst enemy of good ideas is the need to implement them. In the present case, this refers to the challenge of designing an actual system of separated banking functions. In the theoretical debate, an imaginary line is drawn between investment banking and commercial banking. But where exactly would that line be drawn in reality?If commercial banking is supposed to support the real economy, it should comprise more than just lending money. Take the example of Germany, which has a bank-based system of corporate finance. German companies procure a wide range of services from their banks. The boundaries between customer business, hedging transactions, market making and traditional proprietary trading are consequently fluid. Finding the right dividing line in the grey area between those activities would be difficult and prone to lobbyism.The fact that current legislation and legislative proposals are so different in content and scope partly reflects these problems. In the US, the Volcker Rule seeks to prohibit proprietary trading by banks and places severe restrictions on certain forms of investment. In the UK, the Vickers proposal seeks to ring-fence deposit-taking and the provision of credit facilities in legal, organisational and operational terms. In Europe, the Liikanen Commission suggests yet another model which would maintain the universal bank within a holding structure but ring-fence deposit-taking units.Based on the arguments I have laid out, it seems unclear to me whether breaking up the banks would take us all the way to financial stability. It could make banks somewhat easier to resolve - that much is clear. But there are three crucial points on which I have doubts and which should be discussed in more detail: I doubt that breaking up the banks would make them safe enough; I doubt that breaking up the banks would ensure that they can fail without disrupting the system; and I doubt that the proposal of breaking up the banks could be implemented in a suitable manner.I also doubt whether it is the responsibility of the state to determine what business model works best. In my view, we do not need the same business model all over the world. A lot of countries, including Germany, fared very well with universal banks. Personally, I therefore do not see a reason to abandon the concept of universal banks. And as a matter of fact, legislative proposals such as the Liikanen-proposal also do not seek to abolish universal banks as a general concept.Why not let the market determine which business models work and which don’t? And please do not misunderstand me: the state certainly has to set boundaries to guide this selection process and to protect the financial system, the real economy, depositors and the taxpayer.In my view, other things are at least equally important if we want to secure financial stability. To make banks safer, we have to increase capital requirements. Banks need more capital and they need better capital. This is exactly what the new Basel rules prescribe. To enable banks to fail without disrupting the financial system, we need resolution mechanisms. At the international level, the Financial Stability Board has published relevant principles. At the European level, a Single Resolution Mechanism is under construction. This mechanism will be a central pillar of the banking union and should be established as soon as possible.In my view, these measures are more important and bring us closer to financial stability than just breaking up the banks. And I would like to bring up a final point: we must be aware that we cannot solve all our problems through regulation. In addition to regulatory reform, there also has to be a change of culture within the world of banking. And here, investment banks might, on balance, have to change more than commercial banks. Just take the example of compensation schemes. Compensation schemes that reward excessive risk-taking need to be replaced with more sustainable solutions. Relevant regulation exists but to be really effective these rules must become part of the culture.Ladies and gentlemen, I began my speech with an account of how Alexander the Great solved the seemingly insoluble problem of the Gordian Knot. Instead of attempting to untie it as everyone else had done, he just split the knot with his sword.This is certainly the most famous version of the story, but it is not the only one. There are alternative accounts of how Alexander untied the cart from its pole. According to Aristobulus, Alexander unfastened the cart by removing the pin which secured the yoke to the pole of the cart, then pulled out the yoke itself.This exemplifies that there is never only one solution to a given problem. And the more complex a problem is, the less likely that it can be solved with a single stroke of the sword. To the contrary, it could make things even worse. Just recall the story of how Heracles cut off the head of the Hydra, just to have two grow back.To ensure financial stability, we have to apply a wide range of measures. We have to adjust capital requirements, we have to implement liquidity requirements, we have to make banks resolvable to name just a few.Breaking up the banks might shield commercial banking and thereby the real economy to a certain degree. But it cannot, on its own, ensure financial stability. And when it comes to implementing a system of segregated banking functions, attempts to cut the Gordian Knot might mutate into a tedious exercise of splitting hairs.",2014-01-21,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-01-21,"Frankfurt","Germany","ILF Conference","Cutting the Gordian Knot or splitting hairs - the debate about breaking up the banks",2496,17.1,4.8,55.8,9.7,"EN"
"2014-01-27 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","I am delighted to have been invited to speak to you at today's Ifo Institute Munich Seminar.Notwithstanding Mr Sinn's presence, I shall not be mentioning TARGET2 balances, although they certainly represent an important topic, with plenty of scope for discussion. Instead, I shall devote my attention to a subject with which economists have already been preoccupied for quite some time. In fact, they have been jostling with it for so long that it has given birth to a whole raft of jokes.Strangely enough, most of these jokes revolve around the question of how many economists are needed to change a light bulb, the standard answer being: none, on the grounds that if the bulb in question really needed changing, the market would have long since attended to the matter. An alternative answer is that the bulb would have replaced itself - if only the government would let it.As you may have guessed, my subject today is the relationship between the market and the state, a topic which is consistently raised in the aftermath of a crisis. And, needless to say, we've had plenty of crises to contend with in the last few years.On 15 September 2008, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. This ushered in a worldwide financial crisis and a global recession, both of which have greatly burdened the public purse while destroying jobs and diminishing our wealth. In particular, it undermined the confidence of the general public in the market.On 10 May 2010, the euro-area member states decided to provide Greece with financial assistance. This event marked the official onset of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, a crisis which has also eaten into taxpayers' money while eliminating jobs and reducing prosperity. It has also impaired people's trust in their governments, especially in the state's ability to manage its finances competently and overcome crises.This almost simultaneous draining of confidence in the market and in the state is of singular importance for it obstructs the usual reflex reactions after a crisis: to demand either more state intervention or, alternatively, an enhanced emphasis on market forces.However, in my view, these calls for more of the former or more of the latter are in any case often misguided. Periods of deregulation, ie more of the market, often culminate in a crisis. By the same token, periods of reregulation, ie more of the state, often lead to economic stagnation. This amounts to a choice between overheating on the hand and ossification on the other.Poorly considered instinctive reactions are thus likely to take us down the wrong path. It is precisely for this reason that we should regard the simultaneous loss of confidence in the market and state as an opportunity to be grasped. An opportunity to move forward in our efforts to achieve stability.Financial stability is not a matter of choosing between the market and the state. Rather, it is a case of finding the right relationship between the two. Here, we can turn to the tried and tested principle of letting governments lay down the regulations while the market is allowed to function freely. The state defines the perimeter fence while the invisible hand of the market guides events on the playing field.Upon first consideration this would seem to be a relatively simple construct.  But is it really that straightforward in practice? Clearly, it is not. Especially with regard to the financial markets, the task is far from simple. There is a grey area in which the boundary between the market and the state becomes blurred. This grey area arises from the problem of systemic importance.Participants in the financial sector are highly interconnected. These links start with the banks which lend money to one another and finish with complex derivative vehicles in which many players are involved. If a bank runs into trouble, this will also impact on all its counterparties. And if the bank in question is particularly large or has dealings with an especially large number of counterparties, its troubles can upset the balance of the entire financial system. We saw where this scenario led in 2008 when Lehman Brothers became insolvent.In cases like these, the state may have no choice but to rescue the bank concerned in order to prevent an escalation of the crisis. Such rescue efforts are of course extremely costly; in 2010, Ireland was obliged to spend more than 30  percent of its annual economic output on supporting Irish banks. And these costs are ultimately borne by the taxpayer.But this policy not only comes at a cost to the taxpayer; at a deeper level it also changes the structure of the financial system. Large, interconnected banks effectively enjoy insurance protection courtesy of the state. If they encounter distress they can depend on the state to bail them out as they are deemed too big - or too interconnected - to fail.However, this implicit state insurance policy flies in the face of a fundamental principle of the market economy. A principle which Walter Eucken summarised in a single sentence: Those who enjoy the benefits must also bear the costs. This liability principle is the bedrock of any functioning market economy. Once it is abandoned, economic agents change their behaviour, giving rise to moral hazard.Such an environment incentivises large, interconnected banks to enter into high-risk transactions. If these transactions are a success, the bank will reap the benefits, however if the same transactions make a loss, it is the taxpayer who may ultimately suffer. Thus, large interconnected banks intrinsically pose a risk to financial stability. At the same time, this is precisely why they engage in such risk-taking in the first place - which all makes for a dangerous feedback loop.This is where the boundary between market and state becomes blurred, thus generating the aforementioned grey area within which the standard division of responsibilities between market and state ceases to apply. The state's role is no longer confined to setting the rules, rather it becomes an active agent itself on the playing field. And this is the cause of the problems I have described.So how can we redraw the boundary between market and state? We should start by looking at the problem of banks' systemic importance. This should also be the first point we seek to tackle.The question we need to ask is: should banks be allowed to fail? My response is: of course banks should be allowed to fail. The possibility of market exit is a key element of any market economy. Business models that fail to succeed must make way for better business models.However, with respect to systemically important banks, this principle does not apply. In reality, as Martin Hellwig described in his book The Banker's New Clothes, and I quote: The question of whether banks should be allowed to fail is, however, seldom raised as a basic starting principle. I have just elaborated on the reasons for this. So how we should go about re-establishing the possibility of failure for all banks, including systemically important ones, as a fundamental principle?What we need are mechanisms that enable a bank to be wound up without causing the entire financial system to get into difficulties. Only then will banks be confronted with the real threat of a market exit and only then will it be possible to do away with the implicit state guarantee; only then will banks have an incentive to behave in a risk-aware manner.Resolution mechanisms of the kind I describe are, however, complex to install, not least because large banks are usually multinational in nature. They frequently have dozens of affiliates spread across numerous countries. In order to be able to wind up such a bank, we need international cooperation based on a sound legal foundation. In this context, initial steps have already been taken at the international and the European level. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go.One question is particularly important when winding up a bank: who will pay for its resolution? Here, a clear hierarchy of responsibility must be established. The bank's owners and creditors have to be first in line when it comes to bearing the losses, with taxpayers at the bottom of the list. This is the only way to reinstate the principle of liability according to which those who enjoy the benefits also must bear the costs.This bail in option will therefore be an important component of the Single Resolution Mechanism which is planned at the European level.This mechanism is intended as a key pillar of the banking union, and it is vital that it does indeed fulfil that role. In future, the shareholders and creditors of failing banks are to be the first in line to bear the resulting resolution costs, followed by a resolution fund financed by the banking sector. Bail-outs using public funds - and hence taxpayers' money - are to be a last resort.In short, clearly defined bank resolution mechanisms will help us to address the problem of systemic importance. And they will therefore play a crucial role in redrawing the boundaries between the market and the state. Of course, this doesn't mean that we want as many banks as possible to fail.In a market economy, banks should fail if their business model is unsuccessful - if the problem therefore stems from the bank and its structures. Yet banks should not crumble under the force of each and every external shock - every economic downturn or burst asset price bubble - that they experience. Wherever possible, banks must be capable of weathering those kinds of storms.In view of all this, I believe that two elements will be especially important in making banks more stable: capital and liquidity. Deficits in both of these things were factors which contributed significantly to the financial crisis. The state can bring in regulation to address these deficits, and has done so very successfully. Amending the capital and liquidity requirements was therefore very high on the international reform agenda right from the start.And the new Basel III regime significantly raises capital requirements for banks. In future, banks will need to hold more - and better-quality - capital, and the requirements for systemically important financial institutions are stricter still. In addition, Basel III has introduced the very first international liquidity standard.These rules will play a crucial role in safeguarding financial stability. However, there is still a weak link in the capital rules - as the euro-area crisis has clearly shown.The need to bail out systemically important banks with taxpayers' money puts pressure on government budgets. That was one of the focal points of the first part of my speech here today, and I mentioned Ireland as a striking example. Yet problems can also flow in the opposite direction: shaky public finances can cause difficulties for banks. Greece is a case in point.This kind of contagion is mainly caused by government bonds held on bank balance sheets. And many banks have large holdings of domestic government bonds, especially in the euro area. Take Italy and Spain, for example. Current figures show that Italian banks hold more than 10  percent of all bonds issued by the Italian public sector, and that Spanish banks hold almost 9  percent of Spanish public bonds.Essentially, this is a vicious circle: a country's public finance problems spill over to domestic banks, while banks' woes place a strain on government budgets in the country where they are based. To better protect public finances, we need bank resolution mechanisms and the option of a bail-in. But how can we shield banks most effectively from the impact of public finance problems?These risks stem from government bonds held on bank balance sheets. And that is precisely where the problem needs to be tackled. Bank regulation treats government bonds comparatively generously. Usually, the higher the risk attached to a loan, the more capital a bank must hold against it. Yet this does not apply to lending to governments - and thus to government bonds. Bank regulation classifies them universally as risk-free.Yet since the onset of the sovereign debt crisis, if not before, this treatment has no longer seemed justified, as it has become apparent that government bonds do carry some solvency risk. It would therefore be appropriate to change the rules in the medium term. We believe that government bonds, just like other loans, should be backed with sufficient capital to reflect the risks that they carry. At the same time, a ceiling could be imposed on lending to any one government, just as lending to other borrowers is subject to a limit of this kind. These two measures combined would shield banks from the impact of public finance problems.By adjusting the rules, governments can help to make banks, and hence the financial system, more stable. However, rules are only effective in the areas where they apply. And there is one area of the financial system which is not yet truly regulated: the shadow banking system.I have to confess that I don't really like the term shadow banking, as it strikes me as slightly unfair. It makes the industry sound rather shady, or even criminal. And that certainly isn't the case. The shadow banking system contains entities which, like banks, perform credit intermediation. The difference is that these entities - such as US-style money market funds - don't belong to the regulated banking sector. Shadow banks are not bound by the normal rules of play.In terms of financial stability, the crux of the matter is that these entities can cause similar risks to banks but are not subject to bank regulation.And the shadow banking system can certainly generate systemic risks which pose a threat to the entire financial system.Much the same applies to insurance companies. Although they aren't a direct component of the shadow banking system, they can also be a source of systemic risk. All of this makes it appropriate to extend the reach of regulation.In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the three main points of my speech. First, we need to redraw the boundaries between the state and the market by tackling and solving the problem of systemically important banks. Second, the state needs to amend bank regulation - not least by requiring banks to hold capital against government bonds. And third, the state must extend the reach of regulation. The shadow banking system and insurance companies also warrant our attention - albeit for very different reasons.These three aspects are crucial to ensuring financial stability, but they will not be sufficient on their own. We need to be clear about one thing - we cannot achieve financial stability through regulation alone. Government regulation sets a framework for the market, but all market participants have to behave responsibility within those confines. To paraphrase the Roman philosopher Seneca, decency may forbid what the law does not - and we cannot stress this principle often enough.At the moment, there is reason to doubt whether all of our citizens truly believe that banks are capable of the kind of decency we need to see. The many unforgivable market manipulation scandals of recent years have further undermined public trust in the willingness of banks to behave responsibly. And that is a dire situation to be in, as bank business is largely based on trust. To lose that is to risk losing everything.So this trust urgently needs to be restored. Stricter regulation can help in this process, but the banks themselves must also do their part to remedy the situation. They have to show that they are prepared to make changes that go above and beyond what the law requires. They must show that they are capable of pushing through the necessary change of culture in the banking industry.It will be crucial for banks to behave in a manner which reflects what they really are: service providers for the real economy. Financial transactions are not an end in themselves. If we can instil this idea in people's minds, we'll be able to take the final key step in our quest for greater stability.",2014-01-27,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-01-27,"München","Germany","Münchner Seminar des ifo-Instituts","Striving to achieve stability - Regulations and markets in the light of the crisis",2684,18,4.8,52.5,10.3,"EN"
"2014-01-28 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","It is a great privilege for me to speak at the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability, and I wish to thank Professors Siekmann and Wieland for their invitation. An invitation from an institute of this name certainly cannot fail to impress a central banker.One of the central objectives of the IMFS is to promote the exchange of views between scientists, and the transfer of knowledge between academics, financial institutions and central banks. Against this backdrop, I am very happy to be here and to present today's distinguished lecture on The state as a banker?The question mark at the end of the title signals that the state playing an active role as a banker is something which should be called into doubt. The issue is indeed closely connected with the fundamental conceptual question of financial stability and our market economy in general.If one were to ask the question whether or not the market economy merits our trust, another question has to be added immediately: Does the state merit our trust?In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the two questions are unfortunately inseparably linked. I believe that the loss of confidence in our economic system, or in parts thereof, has a lot to do with this blurring of the lines between the public and financial sector, and here mainly between the state and the banks.Both have suffered a loss in confidence over the last few years - the banks as a result of the financial crisis, of scandals and of manipulations, and the state, at least in Europe, as a result of the European sovereign debt crisis.In the past, a discussion similar to the topic of my speech would have focused on the traditional direct links between the public sector and parts of the financial sector. And by that, I am referring to the state as an owner of banks. And indeed, one can call into question whether such a role is appropriate.Nowadays, such a narrow focus seems less fitting for two reasons:First, implicit guarantees for, and explicit bail-outs of, banks have become an omnipresent phenomenon since 2008 for those parts of the sector generally viewed as too big to fail or too interconnected to fail.Second, Europe's banks have substantially increased their investments in sovereign bonds. Over the last few years they have invested increasingly in bonds of their home governments and their home regions.The links between bank risks and sovereign risks have become much stronger, not looser, in recent years. Nonetheless, the reasons for this development are more nuanced than simply the outright public ownership of banks. In any case, it is critical from a financial stability perspective, especially for those countries hit by the European debt crisis, and indirectly for the entire financial system.So the links between the state and the banks, between the public and the financial sector have become a challenge for financial stability - despite the fact that they are partly a result of measures needed to ensure financial stability.In his book Our wealth and its enemies, the German journalist Gabor Steingart describes the blurring of lines between banks and the state as follows:Precisely in the centre […] of our market economy a mutation took place. The close connection between risk-taking and responsibility, a constitutive element of the market economy, was decoupled […]. An economic hybrid came into the world, which skipped over the border between the state and the private economy.Journalists are, of course, entitled to use a more controversial tone, but in my view there is some truth in this argument. Blurring the lines between the state and banks risks deforming our market economy and our thinking about it.Sometimes it seems as if we are witnessing a transformation of values and a redefinition of fundamental concepts. The close connection between risk-taking and liability, which is an important element of a market economy, has weakened.Conservative and risk-averse business models have become somewhat old-fashioned. If the state is bearing a significant part of the losses in the case of a default of a bank, banks are encouraged to take on more risks.High capital buffers which were originally viewed as a sign of a sound bank became an obstacle for maximising the return on equity. And those banks that nonetheless followed a sustainable strategy ran the risk of being punished by the markets. Long termism has been increasingly replaced by short termism.Bonuses are another example of transformation and redefinition. In the past, bonuses were seen as additional income for those working better and harder. Nowadays, they are generally regarded suspiciously as an instrument of inappropriate enrichment.I believe that an analysis of the reasons for inappropriately high bonuses in the banking industry reveals a combination of two factors. First, bonuses were correlated to the return on equity, such that operating with low equity and high debt led to a higher return and thus higher bonuses. Second, there are implicit guarantees by states, meaning that the risk associated with low equity ratios has been socialised - at least partially.All these symptoms are the result of violated market principles and blurred lines between the state and the banks. They are not the result of a well-designed market economy but rather indicative of deformed economies. However, the market economy stands accused of these faults.Of course, the million dollar question is: how can we successfully redraw the line between the state and the banks?In my view, the solution is to be found in returning the state to its role of providing a framework in which the private sector can operate. This means a return to the role the founding fathers of the social market economy had in mind.They knew that good banking regulation is a key element of a well-designed framework for a well-functioning banking industry and a proper market economy in general.The problem is, however, how to achieve such a return to fundamental concepts of a well-designed market economy. This is not at all easy.Ultimately, five years on from the Lehman insolvency, the too big to fail problem is far from being solved and remains a real threat. The damage resulting from the default of a bank deemed too big to fail can affect many, even beyond those directly involved.Excessive borrowing by such banks exposes all of us to risks, costs and inefficiencies. The bankruptcy of a too big to fail institution can cause severe disruption and damage to the global financial system. Stock prices can implode. Money markets can dry up. Other banks can face the prospect of default. And it can cause a severe downturn in the real economy.So, should we allow banks to fail? As a matter of principle the answer is: of course. Nevertheless, as Martin Hellwig and Anat Admati point out in their book The Bankers' New Clothes: The question of whether banks should be allowed to fail rarely arises as a matter of principle. Thus one would argue that, from a policymaker's perspective, it may be better to forget about principles and to do what needs to be done to prevent immediate damage.However, beyond the necessities of the moment, letting banks fail might have positive effects. If the threat of failure is credible, then it may encourage banks to behave prudently. The financial system is likely to become smaller and better capitalised. If the threat is not credible, however, the prospect of benefiting from the too big to fail status can give banks strong incentives to grow, borrow and take risks in a way that exploits implicit guarantees, making the overall costs of failure even higher.So it is not at all sufficient to commit to the principle that banks should be allowed to fail: the threat of failure has to be credible. Credibility, in turn, requires two things. First, the costs of a bank failure for the overall economy have to be reduced significantly. I will discuss this issue in more detail later. Second, credibility requires consistent legal frameworks across countries that make it possible to master the process of resolving a bank.Especially in the international context, practicability of resolution procedures is difficult to achieve. Systemically important banks have large numbers of entities in many countries, all with their own procedures and supervisory tradition. Without a sound legal basis and close cooperation, resolution measures executed in one country may often not be recognised by other legislative authorities. During the financial crisis, national authorities froze assets and liquidity pools of banks within their jurisdictions to avoid the risk of not having them at their disposal when needed. This kind of ring-fencing has significantly impeded restructuring.To make the threat of failure credible, we need international agreements that are binding. They should leave no room for a prisoner’s dilemma in which some countries are better off not cooperating and freezing asset and liquidity pools early on. A well-coordinated approach between authorities is therefore needed. The purpose is to maintain systemically important activities while resolution procedures are applied. Coordination and advanced planning of resolution measures enable authorities to consider financial stability from an international point of view, not merely from a national perspective.International cooperation should establish a common assessment of an institution's risk profile and coordinate supervisory reactions accordingly. To achieve this, the Financial Stability Board has determined core elements of effective cooperation.The first element is the institution-specific cross-border cooperation agreements for global systemically important financial institutions. They form the legal basis for cooperation.The second element constitutes crisis management groups for each systemically important institution. Their role is to assess a bank's resolvability and to support the process of recovery and resolution planning.The third element is a specific resolution strategy. This is the key component of resolution planning. The strategy will be chosen according to the respective business model.In the same vein, we need to establish the Single Resolution Mechanism as a central pillar of the European Banking Union. It will be a quantum leap if the bail-in principle is generally accepted as it is foreseen by ECOFIN. If banks incur losses in the future, shareholders and creditors will be first in line to bear these losses; the taxpayer, on the other hand, will be last in line. If the bail-in principle is implemented as currently foreseen, bail-ins are going to become the rule, bail-outs the exception.With the envisaged general acceptance of the bail-in principle, an important necessary condition for a return to the fundamental principle of market economies will be fulfilled: control and liability will be in balance, those who make the decisions will bear the costs.I argued how important it is that the Single Resolution Mechanism be applied effectively in the spirit of the bail-in principle.As I mentioned earlier, the bail-in threat can only be credible if the costs of the failure of a systemically important bank are significantly reduced. Without reducing these costs, the bail-in threat would be questionable. The overall costs of a failure would be greater than the costs of a bail-out. Hence, establishing effective resolution procedures and reducing the overall costs of a bank failure are two sides of the same coin.This is where good bank capitalisation comes into play. It is the other side of the coin. Good regulation should directly address the key problem. If the system is too fragile, an important and direct measure to reduce fragility is to have enough capital.With the Basel III requirements, regulation is taking an important step in the right direction. Banks have to hold not only more capital but also capital of a higher quality. The system is therefore more resilient now compared with the situation after the Lehman insolvency. And German banks are going to anticipate the higher regulatory requirements of Basel III.Good capitalisation will have the positive side effect of reducing many of the wrong incentives and distortions created by taxpayers’ implicit guarantees and therefore making the bail-in threat more credible ex ante.More equity reduces the likelihood of distress and insolvency, and therefore the likelihood that a situation occurs in which a bail-out is inevitable. This, in turn, makes the bail-in threat more credible ex ante. With higher equity, the unity of risk-taking and liability is restored. Furthermore, with higher capital requirements, banks have lower incentives to become too-big-to-fail. Thus a natural tendency to become smaller and less interconnected might evolve, again making the bail-in threat more credible ex ante.If capital requirements are higher, not only the probability of failure is reduced markedly, but also shareholders and creditors would bear more of the losses incurred by the bank. Thus banks can no longer benefit from their former too big to fail status by borrowing cheaply.Here I can see many practitioners objecting on the grounds that capital is too scarce and too expensive. In this line of reasoning, shareholders have a certain expectation about the return on capital. If the equity share is increased, other things being equal, expenditures are greater than in a situation with higher borrowed capital.The crux of the matter is this: all other things are not equal. This is because the required return on capital contains a risk premium. And the risk premium falls if the capital is increased, which means that the entrepreneurial risk is spread over more capital. There is no way around the fact that the risk premium and the required return on capital should go down if the capital share goes up.Explicit and implicit guarantees for systemically important institutions as well as tax subsidies for loan capital mean that borrowing is eventually being subsidised. From the point of view of a big bank, loan capital becomes cheaper than equity capital.Is the practitioners' view that equity capital leads to higher costs therefore right in this context after all? No, because the implicit guarantee on loan capital means that, in the event of a crisis, the costs are transferred to the general public or, in other words, the taxpayer. This results in a disconnection between individual and social costs and benefits, as was pointed out by the German Council of Economic Experts.There is fallout from this, of course. It sets the wrong incentives. It favours highly leveraged business models. It gives an excessive stimulus to risk-taking. In short, it creates moral hazard. Thus, if a higher input of borrowed capital is cheaper for the bank, this is only because the costs of this are payable elsewhere. Conversely, the business costs of higher capital requirements are offset by relief elsewhere, namely for the taxpayer. And we should not forget the positive effects that larger capital buffers have for financial stability, which I have already described.From an individual perspective, one can, of course, well understand that bankers are resistant to higher capital requirements. But from an overall economic perspective, we have to consider negative externalities for society as a whole.Ladies and gentlemen,There is a close relationship between the state and the banks due to implicit guarantees. This is not in line with the core principles of a market economy. These guarantees are threatening to destroy the close connection between risk-taking and liability and have created wrong incentives for the risk-taking behaviour of banks. Thereby the social costs of a failure of a big bank have increased. Given these high costs, a bail-out seemed ultimately inevitable.To overcome this situation, we need well-designed and credible bail-in procedures. The practicability of resolution regimes requires coordination under the institutional setting as foreseen by the Single Resolution Mechanism. And we have to reduce the overall costs of a failure. Without reducing these costs, any bail-in procedure would lack credibility. High capital buffers would reduce the overall costs of letting a systemically important bank fail. Hence, practicable bail-in procedures and higher capital buffers are two sides of the same coin.If we follow this approach in real life, we have the opportunity to make important headway towards redrawing the lines between the public and the financial sectors, between the state and banks. And thus we also have the opportunity to restore confidence in our banking sector, our public sector and in our economic market system as a whole in the spirit of those who advocated our social market economic system so brilliantly, in the spirit of Ludwig Erhard and the founding fathers of the social market economy.Let me sum up: First, blurring the lines between the state and banks threatens to destroy the unity of risk-taking and liability. Second, redrawing those lines calls for credible and practicable bail-in procedures. Third, for these procedures to be credible, the overall costs of a failure have to be reduced through higher capital buffers. Fourth, the state is not a good banker and should not try to become a banker.

"2014-02-11 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","Paul Samuelson once said, I don't care who writes a nation's laws, or crafts its treatises, if I can write its economics textbooks.Paul Samuelson wasn’t just one of the foremost economists of the last century, he was also a master of the punch line. And I can well imagine that this knack made him a firm favourite among fellow economists. Yet in my opinion, this viewpoint fails to consider important links between economic theory and legislation. The economic analysis of law provides a large number of examples of the extent to which legislation affects economic life. And a good proportion of legal rules are ultimately based, among other things, on economic insights such as that independent central banks are the best guarantors of price stability, or that the monetary financing of governments undermines a stability-oriented economic order.Thus, economists ignore the consequences of legislation and jurisdiction at their own peril. I would say that a lively exchange of ideas between lawyers and economists not only makes sense: it is absolutely imperative. I am therefore delighted to be able to carry this dialogue forward with you here today, and I thank you for your invitation.Just how fruitful an exchange of ideas between economists and lawyers can be is illustrated by a concept that has had a lasting influence on German economic policy: that of regulatory policy. It was a most odd coincidence, as the legal scholar Franz Böhm later put it, that brought himself, his colleague Hans Grossmann-Doerth and the economist Walter Eucken together in 1933 at the Faculty of Law and Political Science at the University of Freiburg. It is here that the three set about researching and teaching, and that was when German ordoliberalism, the Freiburg School, was born.Shaped by the experiences of the global economic crisis and of a totalitarian command economy, the core element of ordoliberalism is competition, yet no longer competition in the classic - unbridled - sense, but a protected, orderly competition. Or, as Federal President Joachim Gauck described it in his speech at the Walter Eucken Institute a few weeks ago: Neither is it an order that subjects the individual to state paternalism, nor is it a market in which the strong can become so big that they themselves dictate the rules.Ordoliberalism, then, is about more than striving for economic efficiency. As the Federal President also pointed out: By breaking long-standing privileges and cemented power structures, competition offers scope for more participation, more inclusion.What is crucial with regard to ordoliberalism is an appropriate framework within which orderly competition can take place. According to Walter Eucken, such a framework can be described as what he called constitutive and regulative principles of a competitive order.Of central importance in this respect is a smoothly functioning pricing system. This is because, in a market economy, prices play a decisive information and steering function, regardless of whether they are the prices for goods, services or assets.Walter Eucken adds to this fundamental principle six other principles which together characterise a competitive order: open markets, freedom of contract, constancy (in the sense of consistency or reliability) of economic policy, liability for one’s own actions, private ownership and the primacy of monetary policy, the latter being of particular interest to me as a monetary policy maker.Thus, economic policy must fulfil two tasks. First, it has to spell out these principles in the form of suitable rules to ensure that they become operable - which in some circumstances may also mean justiciable -, that they can be set in relation to each other, and that they actually develop a binding force. Second, economic policy must align the requirements of a competitive order with other political ends, for example if the results of market processes are undesirable from a social-political perspective.Keeping an eye on the social consequences of market processes is an important supplement to regulatory policy and the hallmark of a social market economy. The relationship between market forces, their social consequences and interventions to correct them is often complex. This means that obvious measures aren’t always the best ones, and sometimes they aren’t even effective: it is indeed true that good intentions do not always produce good results.It’s for policy-makers to weigh up different objectives, and economists cannot take that responsibility from them. But economists can and should point out the economic costs and side-effects of the different courses of action available.A cursory consideration of this job description perhaps seems to suggest that the Keynesian ideal of the economist as a dentist might become reality. To quote Keynes: If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people on a level with dentists, that would be splendid.I am afraid, however, that this notion of the economist’s role will remain a pious hope. Most economists are indeed humble or competent people - and sometimes they are both.But in the past few years, insights gained in the field of economics have probably experienced more ardent debate than the latest findings on dentistry. For given the complexity of reality, the dynamics of an increasingly interlinked global economy and the uncertainty that upheavals like the financial and economic crisis in particular generate, there are often no simple answers to economic policy questions. What is more, these answers may change with time.On the one hand, the specific set-up of an efficient competitive order is subject to constant change. As the framework conditions shift, so the regulatory principles I have just mentioned may have to be re-operationalised. At the same time, it is important to weigh other social policy objectives anew against the requirements of a competitive order, if necessary. On the other hand, not even a rule-bound, regulatory policy-driven economic set-up can do without discretionary decisions.Generally speaking, therefore, rules are needed to give validity to regulatory principles such as the principles of competition and liability. They have to narrow the scope for action of participants in the economic process in such a way that market forces produce better economic results - results which are also more sustainable and more socially just than those of unbridled competition or of a centrally planned economy.To this end, the appropriateness of a given regulatory framework must be constantly reviewed, and adjustments made where necessary.One such example is Agenda 2010. At that time, the rules laid down in employment and social welfare laws had shown themselves to be major obstacles to labour market entry, even in times of an economic upswing. In consequence, unemployment continued to rise across the business cycles until it reached a level that was no longer sustainable.The measures that were then taken boosted flexibility, lowering the barriers to entering the labour market. For example, the liberalisation of temporary employment makes it easier for employers to hire job-seekers. Moreover, the amalgamation of unemployment assistance and social assistance and the shortening of the period of entitlement to unemployment benefits increased the incentive to take up employment.Competition on the labour market has tended to become stiffer as a result, and no doubt also tougher for some. But it has also helped the labour force in Germany to swell to around 42 million - more than ever before. Moreover, the number of persons registered as unemployed has dropped from a high of more than 5 million to just under 3 million at present, and the chances of an unemployed person finding a new job are far greater than they were before the reform.Further evidence of the success of the reforms is that, in the wake of the upturn, not only atypical jobs were created. For instance, from 2003 to shortly before the crisis, the number of temporary workers advanced by almost 400,000. At the same time, however, the number of jobs subject to social security contributions posted an increase of around 1,250,000. Nor has this picture changed since the economic slump.But this outcome also owed a great deal to the fact that the social partners could respond to the shift in the economic setting with a degree of leeway, notably by concluding more employment-friendly wage agreements as well as the liberalisation clauses designed to safeguard employment which have been a standard feature of collective agreements ever since the Pforzheim agreement back in 2004. Research findings suggest that these measures were key contributory factors in restoring competitiveness and in keeping the increase in unemployment to a minimum during the economic downturn brought about by the financial crisis.The financial crisis likewise showed us just how important it is to have the right setting for a functioning competitive framework.The central regulatory tenet - that those who enjoy the benefits must also bear the costs - was neutralised for major banks who could count on being rescued by the taxpayer because of their importance for the economy.Keeping profits in the private realm, but expecting taxpayers to foot the bill if a crisis arises undermines responsible behaviour. Rules that are consistent with the principle of liability and which ensure that banks, say, take a leaf out of the business community’s book and shoulder their losses themselves in future without jeopardising financial stability, are vitally important for a functioning economic order.This is a prime example of the tensions I was referring to earlier on in my speech between the regulatory framework and discretionary economic policy intervention. Principles-driven policy action and a set of clearly defined rules which limit the scope for economic policy discretion make economic policymaking more predictable and can help to defuse many problems such as that of time inconsistency, which is a topic I shall return to later in my speech. Questions were even raised during the crisis as to whether complying with this regulatory framework was always necessary or even possible in the first place.Insolvency law fleshes out the principle of liability. But had it been rigorously applied, without exception, to systemically important financial institutions, many fear that this would have come at a prohibitively high cost as a result of the risk of contagion to other financial market participants and the escalation of the crisis.If I may, I would now like to look into a number of selected policy spheres to give you a rough idea of how rules-based and ad hoc decision-making ought to interact in principles-driven policymaking - and where the strict limits of discretionary policymaking need to lie.I will kick off with a policy area which is especially close to my heart, and not just for professional reasons - monetary policy.Walter Eucken believed that monetary policy was crucially important: All endeavours to realise a competitive framework are in vain unless a certain level of monetary stability can be assured.Monetary policy thus has primacy for the competitive order, he wrote in his Principles of Economic Policy. You won’t be surprised to hear that as a central banker, I share Eucken’s views on the importance of monetary policy.A key problem in the sphere of monetary policy - one which is a factor in many other areas of economic policy as well - is that of time inconsistency. Let me illustrate this phenomenon using an example originally created by the US economist Professor Alan Blinder.Imagine a professor who is pursuing two goals. First, he wants his students to study as hard as possible; second, he wants to spend as little time as possible marking examination papers, say. The professor then announces that he intends to set an examination at the end of the semester. This, he hopes, will provide the students with an incentive to acquire the necessary knowledge.However, once the students have studied for the end-of-semester examination, the professor has an incentive not to set an examination after all because he does not want to mark the examination papers. But because the students are aware of the professor’s incentive, they will study insufficiently or not at all.How can this problem be solved? By stating in the examination regulations that an examination will be set at the end of the semester, come what may. In other words, the university binds itself in advance to a fixed rule.In their renowned paper Rules, discretion and reputation in a model of monetary policy, the US economists Robert Barro and David Gordon explain why the time-inconsistency problem gives rise to an inherent inflation bias.In the short term, monetary policy can impact not just on inflation but also on economic activity and hence on employment, although the monetary policy I am talking about here is not mandate-consistent expansionary monetary policy in times of weak economic growth and low inflation rates, but additional monetary policy stimulus.Expansionary monetary policy surprises drive inflation higher but real wages decrease, prompting enterprises to hire more staff, and briefly boost employment and growth. Politically, this can be quite an attractive outcome that will initially be welcomed by the general public.Yet the macroeconomic outcome looks quite different if employees are expecting this kind of monetary policy move - inflation again begins to climb, but real wages remain static because employees - anticipating a more expansionary monetary policy stance - have already managed to secure higher wages.And that’s the worst of all possible worlds - higher inflation but no stimulus for the economy. This phenomenon, otherwise known as stagflation, plagued many industrialised countries in the 1970s.Now the crux of the matter is that precisely this poor outcome will transpire as long as monetary policymakers gear their stance towards short-term sentiment about their policy. Because economic agents will always expect an expansionary policy measure and factor it into their expectations - just like students who anticipate that no examination paper will be set and give up studying. As a consequence, the only way to resolve this dilemma is for monetary policymakers to make a credible commitment to a stability strategy - and thus to credibly forgo the option of using expansionary monetary policy surprises to give the economy a short-lived shot in the arm.Tying central banks to a very strict set of rules, that is, to an automatic system for regulating the money supply, was something that Milton Friedman had in mind. True to his belief that money is too important to be left to central bankers, Friedman put forward a proposal back in the 1960s that central banks should be required to increase the money supply by a constant percentage so as to counteract the inherent incentives to pursue an inflationary monetary policy.But this would only work if there was a stable correlation between monetary growth and inflation, and the central bank had a sufficiently reliable degree of control over the money supply. But the correlation between the money supply and inflation is not always sufficiently stable over time, least of all in times of crisis, so one of the key prerequisites for managing the money supply is lacking.This is why Barro and Gordon saw central bank independence and a commitment by monetary policymakers to maintaining price stability as a suitable means of achieving price stability while at the same time granting the central bank a degree of monetary policy leeway. And so it was. A host of empirical surveys including those by Alesina and Summers and by Grilli, Masciandaro and Tabellini confirm the success of independent central banks which are mandated to maintain price stability.And to get an idea of just how beneficial it can be to incorporate a degree of flexibility into a clear commitment to the primary goal of price stability, we only need to look at the role played by central banks in stabilising the global economy when the financial crisis was at its worst in the autumn and winter of 2008.But how can we make sure that a degree of monetary policy leeway does not distract us from the goal of price stability? In two ways: by embracing the primary goal of price stability and central bank independence; and by fostering public confidence and thus underpinning the credibility of the central bank’s stability strategy.Central banks can build up credibility in two ways. First, by successfully safeguarding price stability for years. A track record like that also protects their independence. As Harold James once put it, confidence is the hard-won core working capital of central banks which it would be very costly to jeopardise.Another way in which central banks can bolster the credibility of their stability strategy is by committing to an appropriate monetary policy strategy and interpreting their mandate narrowly. Indeed, what the Economist wrote back in 1990 remains true to this very day: The only good central bank is one that can say no to politicians.Independent central banks need strict limits to their flexibility, such as a ban on monetary financing, so that their independence is not ultimately called into question, especially so in a framework that is as complex as the European Monetary Union. Only this will ensure that the goal of price stability does not take a back seat to preserving government solvency, even in times of crisis.Both theoretical analyses and historical experience show that sound public finances are key to a successful, stability-oriented monetary policy - especially in a monetary union. This is one reason why it also makes sense to create rules for fiscal policy.However, it is clear, too, that these need to be different to monetary policy rules, because fiscal policy involves a much greater degree of redistribution, which requires democratic legitimacy. Because the parliaments have fiscal sovereignty, an independent staff is hardly possible, though limits on the room for fiscal policy manoeuvre are - through a debt brake, for instance.Of course, this also depends on how the rule is structured. An effective rule should leave enough room for policy makers to accommodate the economic situation or extraordinary events such as natural disasters. In the conflict between binding force and flexibility, the actual binding effect of the rule should be the deciding factor.On the one hand, a nominal debt ceiling such as in the United States appears to be binding if it can be used time and again to push the government to the brink of insolvency in political power struggles stemming from a lack of consensus on a medium-term consolidation strategy. On the other, the ceiling has so far always been raised at the last minute following difficult political negotiations, which implies that it must be possible to design a more effective fiscal rule that is binding in the long term.We have had similar experiences in Germany - under Article 115 of the Basic Law, the government has usually been able to extend the limits on new borrowing - which were, in any case, fairly generous - simply by diagnosing a disruption of the macroeconomic equilibrium. The lessons from the European debt crisis have also taught us that, in practice, the binding effect of our rules was not very strong. Since the start of monetary union, Germany, France and Italy have exceeded the deficit limit of 3 percent in seven, eight and even nine years respectively.  Whether the reforms will put real teeth into the Stability and Growth Pact and the Fiscal Compact in this respect depends heavily on the European Commission and how it uses its extra scope for discretion.The first time the Commission applied the new rules, it showed itself to be very flexible, granting Spain, France, Slovenia and Cyprus longer deadlines to make adjustments than those actually envisaged in the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that such exemptions should be made only in well-founded exceptional cases, for this ultimately weakens the structural consolidation requirements and postpones them until a later date. Making exceptions for a large number of countries simultaneously undermines the disciplining effect of the fiscal rules.In view of past experience with fiscal rules, in particular, I strongly believe that the euro area can only be maintained as a stability union in the long run if its framework sufficiently embodies a key principle of regulatory policy: the principle of liability.In the context of public finances, this means that those who make decisions on spending must also take responsibility for them. In other words, there must be a balance between control and liability.In principle, the Maastricht framework assigned both liability and control to national governments. During the crisis, the EFSF and ESM bailout funds stabilised the euro area but also increased the mutualisation of liability for previous national errors.To restore the balance between control and liability, I only see two plausible options: either we shift powers to monitor and intervene to European level by creating a fiscal union, or we strengthen the member states’ individual liability and responsibility in a return to the Maastricht framework.This also ultimately means that sovereign insolvencies cannot - and must not - be ruled out. They must be possible without also causing the financial system to collapse.The current balancing act between individual responsibility and mutualised liability is likely to lead to new strains in the long run. To exaggerate slightly, as Adorno said, there is no right life in the wrong one.  In order to make the financial system more resilient to crisis, and thus to restore greater validity to the principles of competition and liability, changes will also need to be made to financial market regulation. A particularly severe problem which arose during the crisis was one I mentioned earlier, the too-big-to-fail problem: whenever banks become too large or interconnected to be would up without jeopardising financial stability, this undermines the liability principle and ultimately disrupts competition, and represents an invitation to act irresponsibly. That has to change!Recent developments in the financial sector, such as increased indebtedness and the burgeoning growth of the shadow banking sector, require new rules as well. There must three primary objectives behind these new rules. First, banks have to become more resilient; in other words, they have to acquire a higher quantity of higher-quality capital to protect themselves against potential losses. Second, we need effective resolution mechanisms so that, in a worst-case scenario, banks can exit the market without endangering financial stability. Third, we need to ensure that these rules cannot be circumvented by taking business elsewhere, such as, for instance, to the shadow banking sector. The rules of the game have to apply to all alike.I would like initially to discuss in more detail the objective of improved capital buffers. The new international rules, generally referred to as Basel III, have already taken us a great deal further in this respect. Banks now have to hold more capital and higher-quality capital.However, there are some who believe the Basel III risk-based approach to be fundamentally wrong. The discussion is ultimately about whether capital adequacy rules should be simple or complex. Thus far, capital rules have been complex rules: the capital to be held is determined according to the risk profile of each individual bank’s assets.Critics such as University of Bonn economist Martin Hellwig, however, assert that material risks are not captured at all by the risk weighting. And he adds that banks use the risk weighting to expand their business to, in some cases, one hundred times their capital.And yet the fundamental theory behind risk weighting is quite plausible: if the same percentage of capital is to be held for all assets across the board, this gives banks an incentive to invest particularly in riskier assets in order to increase their return on equity. That will do no favours to financial stability, either.Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, therefore favours a pragmatic approach, saying that sometimes both a belt and suspenders are needed to keep one’s trousers from slipping. Therefore, in his view, a one-size-fits-all rule, in the form of a uniform debt ceiling, should coexist with the current risk-weighting rules.I think this approach makes sense: where there is a threat of major losses that could bring the financial markets even to the brink of meltdown, there is justification - or even a need - for installing multiple security systems. What’s needed for nuclear reactors, for instance, does not seem like a bad idea for the financial system, either.It is also important, though, that these security systems cannot be circumvented by moving assets to less regulated areas such as the shadow banking sector. Much remains to be done in this regard, starting with the enforcement of extensive reporting requirements.To strengthen the liability principle, it is crucial, too, that a bank which, for instance, does not have a sustainable business model be able to exit the market without putting financial stability at risk. Otherwise, competition in the banking sector will be undermined.The implications are shown by a study published as a Bundesbank Discussion Paper Absent an effective bank resolution mechanism, banks could become overly generous in their lending decisions and efforts in terms of ongoing loan monitoring could fall short. Capital would then no longer be allocated to its most productive use; instead, there is a danger that particularly risky lending would tend to be overfunded for too long. And that would weaken the forces of macroeconomic growth.An effective resolution mechanism thus strengthens not only financial stability, but also economic growth. The decisive factor here is not to make the taxpayer foot the bill for resolution - indeed both shareholders and providers of loan capital should bear the losses incurred.This is exactly the approach underlying the work conducted at European level on a new Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). However, there may also be reasons why the BRRD, adopted at the end of last year, gives countries the option of departing from the directive’s strict liability cascade in cases where financial stability is under threat. This is possible, for instance, by exempting certain liabilities or by permitting the use of public funds in the context of a Government Financial Stabilisation Tool as a last-resort measure.However, the market can only impose discipline on the banks in full measure if such exemptions are tightly restricted.This foray through various areas of the economy has shown that the economists’ toolkit is more likely to be the topic of contentious public debate in the future than the dentist’s drill.Keynes’ hope is therefore unlikely to come to pass, too.Although economists are not dentists, they are seen by many as the economy’s doctors, as has been recently noted by Dennis Snower, President of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. At the core, what this means is that, if a new crisis emerges, the best possible therapy needs to be found quickly.In full keeping with evidence-based medicine, we should therefore not lose sight of principles which have withstood the test of time in economics and have been proven by empirical evidence - including, above all, the concept of an independent central bank committed to monetary stability.",2014-02-11,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-02-11,"Karlsruhe","Germany","Juristische Studiengesellschaft","Of dentists and economists - The importance of a consistent economic policy framework",4464,25.3,5.1,31.2,15,"EN"
"2014-02-14 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","es ist eine große Ehre für mich, bei der 470. Bremer Schaffermahlzeit dabei zu sein und die Gästerede halten zu dürfen.Die Schaffermahlzeit ist nicht nur ein besonderes Aushängeschild Bremens, sie ist auch eine der traditionsreichsten Veranstaltungen im ganzen Land. Ich danke dem Haus Seefahrt deshalb sehr herzlich für die Einladung. Ich sage das ausdrücklich auch im Namen der anderen Gäste, die heute das einmalige Erlebnis haben, bei der Schaffermahlzeit dabei zu sein.Wir sind wirklich beeindruckt. Wir haben heute viel über Bremen gelernt, über die Bremer und die bremische Geschichte. Wir haben ausgezeichnet und üppig gespeist und wir haben ordentlich unser Besteck an der Serviette abgewischt - so wie es bewährte Tradition ist bei der Schaffermahlzeit.Ich wurde darum gebeten, zu einem Thema aus meinem beruflichen Umfeld zu sprechen; das möchte ich gerne tun.So möchte ich heute über Geld und Geldwertstabilität reden, über die Aufgabe der Notenbanken und die Bundesbank, über die Bewältigung der Krise im Euro-Raum und die Bewahrung der Währungsunion als Stabilitätsgemeinschaft.Beginnen möchte ich mit einer grundlegenden, aber gar nicht so leicht zu beantwortenden Frage: Was ist eigentlich Geld?Schon Platon und Aristoteles haben kontrovers diskutiert, was Geld ist. In der Literatur findet man häufig die Aussage, dass Geld letztlich das ist, was die Menschen als Geld verwenden - sprich als Zahlungsmittel. Damit ist bereits eine der drei wesentlichen Funktionen genannt, die Geld erfüllen muss, damit es Geld ist: Es muss als allgemeines Tauschmittel dienen. Des Weiteren dient Geld als Rechenmittel und als Wertaufbewahrungsmittel.Die Verwendung von Geld erleichtert unser Leben. Ohne Geld müsste man beschwerlich nach Tauschpartnern suchen, nach dem Motto frierender Bäcker sucht hungrigen Schneider. Und Geld macht die moderne Arbeitsteilung überhaupt erst möglich.Karl Marx sah gerade diesen Aspekt des Geldes kritisch. Er schrieb: Das Geld ist das dem Menschen entfremdete Wesen seiner Arbeit, und dieses fremde Wesen beherrscht ihn, und er betet es an. Tatsächlich gilt in vielen Gesellschaften Geld als Synonym für Reichtum und Macht.Für das Verständnis der Ökonomie ist Geld nicht zentral. Insofern irrt Kurt Tucholsky, wenn er in seinem kurzen Abriß über die Nationalökonomie (1931) schreibt: Die Grundlage der Nationalökonomie ist das sog. 'Geld'.Die Grundlage der Ökonomie ist vielmehr die Knappheit. Erst die Knappheit von Gütern macht wirtschaftliches Handeln überhaupt erforderlich. Im Schlaraffenland wären Ökonomen arbeitslos. Im Schlaraffenland bräuchte man aber auch kein Geld.Dazu fällt mir das Bonmot des österreichischen Dichters Johann Nepomuk Nestroy ein: Die Phönizier haben das Geld erfunden. Aber warum so wenig? Die Antwort ist, weil sich das Problem der Knappheit nicht lösen lässt, indem man das Geld vermehrt.Eine Lehre der Geschichte, nicht zuletzt der deutschen, lautet, wenn der Geldumlauf über längere Zeit deutlich schneller wächst als die gesamtwirtschaftliche Produktion, steigen die Güterpreise. Die hergestellte Gütermenge lässt sich durch mehr Geld bestenfalls kurzfristig steigern.Inflation kann aber ernste negative Folgen haben: Inflation verzerrt die Signale, die die Preise über die relative Knappheit der Güter aussenden. Inflation ist schlecht für das Wachstum einer Volkswirtschaft. Inflation hat unerwünschte Verteilungswirkungen, denn gerade die sozial Schwächeren können sich nicht vor Inflation schützen. Die Rentenzahlungen oder Sozialleistungen lauten schließlich fast immer auf einen festen Währungsbetrag.In ähnlicher Weise sind auch anhaltend sinkende Preise schädlich. Deflation ist sogar noch gefährlicher als Inflation, weil sie schwieriger zu bekämpfen ist. Am besten ist es daher, sowohl Inflation als auch Deflation zu vermeiden. Preisstabilität sollte deshalb die oberste Maxime der Geldpolitik sein.Tatsächlich ist die Geschichte des Geldes und insbesondere die Geschichte des Papiergeldes aber eine Geschichte der Inflation. Zu groß ist meist die Versuchung, mit der Notenpresse die Taschen des Souveräns zu füllen.Zur Prägung von Gold- und Silbermünzen mussten die Münzherren immerhin die entsprechenden Edelmetallvorräte haben. Das setzte der Geldschöpfung gewissermaßen eine natürliche Grenze. Aber auch in diesem Geldsystem versuchten die Münzherren häufig, den Edelmetallgehalt einer bestimmten Münze zu reduzieren, ohne ihren Nominalwert zu verringern. Die Münzen wurden mit der Zeit kleiner, flacher oder ihre Legierung weniger edel.Banknoten kamen in Europa erst im 17. Jahrhundert auf. Anfangs waren sie durch Edelmetallvorräte gedeckt, später nur noch teilweise. In der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts beendeten die Staaten die Deckungspflicht. In Deutschland endete die Möglichkeit der Goldeinlösung von Banknoten mit dem Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs, also vor fast genau 100 Jahren.Und so ist es kein Wunder, dass die schlimmsten Inflationen im 20. Jahrhundert stattfanden. Von 56 Episoden von Hyperinflation, die weltweit gezählt wurden, waren 54 im 20. Jahrhundert.Eine Zentralbank, die nicht zur Einlösung von Banknoten gegen Edelmetall verpflichtet ist, kann Geld quasi aus dem Nichts schaffen. Damit war die Zentralbank in besonderer Weise der Versuchung ausgesetzt, die Finanznöte des Staates durch das Drucken von Geld zu überwinden.Den gefährlichen Zusammenhang von Papiergeldschöpfung, Staatsfinanzierung und Inflation hat übrigens schon Goethe in seinem Faust II eindrucksvoll beschrieben. Es gibt darin eine Szene, in welcher Mephisto dem von Geldnöten geplagten Kaiser rät (ungedecktes) Geld zu drucken: Ich schaffe, was ihr wollt, und schaffe mehr, verspricht Mephisto dem Kaiser.Dank der wundersamen Geldschöpfung kann sich der Kaiser seiner Schulden entledigen und es kommt zu einer vorübergehenden wirtschaftlichen Blüte im Land. Im weiteren Verlauf kommt es aber eben auch zu Inflation und schließlich zur Zerstörung des Geldwesens.Doch was kann man tun, um Geldwertstabilität wirkungsvoll zu sichern? Das Beste ist, die Sicherung der Geldwertstabilität einer Zentralbank zu übertragen, die möglichst unabhängig von den Einflüssen der Regierung ist.Modernes Geld, das keiner Deckungspflicht unterliegt, basiert vor allem auf Vertrauen. Vertrauen darauf, dass die Zentralbank ihr Stabilitätsversprechen halten wird und sich nicht zu Lasten der Geldwertstabilität für andere Zwecke einspannen lässt. Der Historiker Harold James sagt deshalb: Zentralbanken brauchen als Betriebskapital ein Vertrauensguthaben.In Deutschland haben wir das Glück, seit 1948 eine unabhängige Zentralbank zu haben. Sie konnte sich über die Jahre hinweg ein solches Vertrauensguthaben aufbauen. Trotz zum Teil schwieriger Bedingungen war die D-Mark von Anfang an eine stabile Währung. Selbst in den ölkrisengeplagten siebziger Jahren war die Inflationsrate in Deutschland mit durchschnittlich 5 Prozent deutlich niedriger als in vielen anderen Industrieländern.Die Erfahrungen dieser Ära haben weltweit Anstoß dazu gegeben, Notenbanken Unabhängigkeit zu gewähren und ihre Rolle auf die Wahrung der Preisstabilität zu konzentrieren.Das stärkere politische Zusammenwachsen Europas und der sich herausbildende Konsens einer stabilitätsorientierten Geldpolitik führten dazu, dass sich Ende der achtziger Jahre die Pläne für eine europäische Gemeinschaftswährung konkretisierten. Im Dezember 1991 einigte sich der Europäische Rat in Maastricht auf die Gründung einer Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion.Der damalige Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl trat Bedenken bezüglich der Stabilität einer neuen europäischen Währung entgegen und versicherte in seiner Regierungserklärung am 30. Januar 1991: Unser Ziel ist eine einheitliche europäische Währung, die an Stabilität unserer D-Mark nicht nachsteht. Institutionelle Voraussetzung hierfür ist eine unabhängige Europäische Zentralbank, die […] für die Geldpolitik verantwortlich ist und ebenso wie die Deutsche Bundesbank vorrangig der Sicherung der Geldwertstabilität verpflichtet ist.Der institutionelle Aufbau des Eurosystems, also des Zentralbanksystems der Euro-Länder, orientierte sich deshalb eng am Vorbild der Bundesbank. Selbst mit der Wahl des Standorts Frankfurt am Main wurde die Absicht unterstrichen, dass die EZBin der Tradition der Bundesbank steht. Mit dieser engen Anlehnung an die Bundesbank sollte auch das weltweite Vertrauen in ihre Stabilitätsorientierung auf die EZB übertragen werden.Der Euro ist, wie versprochen, eine stabile Währung. In den ersten 15 Jahren - so lange gibt es ihn schon - sind die Preise im Euro-Raum um durchschnittlich 2,0 Prozent pro Jahr gestiegen. Das liegt sogar noch unter den Preissteigerungsraten zu D-Mark-Zeiten, wobei die geldpolitischen Heraus-forderungen in den beiden Zeiträumen aber sehr unterschiedlich waren.Die Krise im Euro-Raum hat jedoch eindrücklich vor Augen geführt, dass die Geldpolitik auch von Bedingungen abhängt, die sie selbst nicht beeinflussen kann.Solide Staatsfinanzen sind eine solche Bedingung: Geraten die Staatsfinanzen aus dem Ruder, wird es für die Zentralbank schwer, Preisstabilität zu gewährleisten.Das gilt besonders in der Währungsunion. Mit der Währungsunion wurde die Geldpolitik vergemeinschaftet, die Finanzpolitik blieb dagegen in der Entscheidungshoheit der Mitgliedstaaten.Die Gefahren, die von dieser Konstruktion ausgehen, wie zum Beispiel die verstärkte Verschuldungsneigung der Staaten, wurden durchaus gesehen. Deswegen wurden ja auch entsprechende Vorkehrungen getroffen. Erstens wurde ein Haftungsausschluss beschlossen: Die Mitgliedstaaten sind nach dieser No Bailout-Regel nicht für die Schulden der anderen Mitgliedstaaten verantwortlich. Zweitens wurde dem Eurosystem untersagt, Kredite an die Mitgliedstaaten zu vergeben oder Staatsanleihen von den Staaten direkt zu erwerben. Drittens wurden Verschuldungsregeln formuliert, die durch den Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt konkretisiert wurden. Übermäßige Staatsdefizite sollten durch ein Verfahren, an dessen Ende finanzielle Sanktionen stehen, möglichst vermieden werden.Leider haben die Mitgliedstaaten gegen diese Spielregeln des Euro zu häufig verstoßen. Auch in Berlin, Paris und Rom hat man die Regeln missachtet und sich erfolgreich dafür eingesetzt, dass entsprechendes Fehlverhalten nicht bestraft wird.Die Konzentration auf die öffentlichen Finanzen erwies sich außerdem als ein Schwachpunkt des Ordnungsrahmens der Währungsunion. Gefahren für die Gemeinschaftswährung gehen nämlich auch von anderen Fehlentwicklungen aus, die in ihrer Bedeutung bei der Konzeption der Währungsunion unterschätzt wurden:Die Einführung des Euro brachte den früheren Hochzinsländern einen deutlichen Zinsrückgang. Durch diesen Vertrauensvorschuss der Anleger und den Wegfall des Wechselkursrisikos floss reichlich Kapital unter anderem von den Kernländern des Euro-Raums wie Deutschland und Frankreich in die Peripherie wie Irland, Spanien und Griechenland.Leider floss dabei viel Geld in den privaten Wohnungsbau oder in den Staatskonsum, was sich als wenig produktiv erwies. Die Kapitalzuflüsse ermöglichten auch eine Zeit lang kräftig steigende Löhne. Da aber die produzierten Gütermengen nicht im gleichen Ausmaß zunahmen, stiegen die Lohnstückkosten. Die internationale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Unternehmen sank rapide.Da die Staaten nun nicht mehr mit einer Abwertung ihrer Währung reagieren konnten, so wie sie es in der Vergangenheit häufig getan hatten, entwickelten sich hohe Leistungsbilanzdefizite. Die private und öffentliche Verschuldung stieg teilweise deutlich an. Kurzum, die Länder lebten über ihre Verhältnisse.Die Krise im Euro-Raum ist mehr als eine Staatsschuldenkrise. Sie ist auch eine Zahlungsbilanzkrise und eine Bankenkrise. Was die Krise aber deutlich gezeigt hat, ist, dass von übermäßiger Verschuldung gravierende Risiken ausgehen.Das wusste übrigens schon Friedrich III. von Brandenburg. Als er sich 1701 zum König Friedrich I. in Preußen krönen ließ, wurde eine Generalamnestie verkündet. Ausgenommen waren lediglich Gotteslästerer, Mörder, Hochverräter und - Schuldenmacher.Die Krise hat ebenfalls gezeigt, wie schnell ein überschuldetes Bankensystem die Zahlungsfähigkeit ganzer Staaten gefährden kann. So wurden auch Staaten in ihrer Stabilität bedroht, die - wie Irland und Spanien - vor der Krise eine relativ niedrige Staatsverschuldung hatten. Die Kapitalströme in die Peripherieländer versiegten mit der Krise, die Finanzierung der Schulden war damit nicht mehr möglich - oder nur noch zu sehr hohen Kosten.In dieser Krisensituation haben die Rettungsschirme der Euro-Staaten, der Europäischen Union und des Internationalen Währungsfonds sowie die Maßnahmen der Notenbanken im Euro-Raum eine Zuspitzung der Krise verhindert.Mit der Euro-Rettungspolitik hat die Staatengemeinschaft aber auch zunehmend Haftung für vergangene Fehlentwicklungen und angehäufte Staatsschulden einzelner Länder übernommen. Damit ist das Verhältnis von Haftung und Kontrolle aus der Balance geraten, die für die Statik der Währungsunion so entscheidend ist.Was muss nun getan werden, um die Währungsunion wieder krisenfester zu machen? Entscheidend ist dabei, dass dem Haftungsprinzip wieder mehr Geltung verschafft wird. Oder um es mit Walter Eucken zu sagen: Wer den Nutzen hat, muss auch den Schaden tragen. Das muss nicht nur für Unternehmen, sondern auch für Banken und Staaten gelten.Für den Ordnungsrahmen der Währungsunion bedeutet das, dass grundsätzlich zwei Wege zu einem stabileren Rahmen möglich sind: Entweder man geht den Schritt hin zu einer vertieften politischen Integration, zum Beispiel eine Fiskalunion, oder man entwickelt den bisherigen Rahmen weiter und stärkt die Eigenverantwortung der einzelnen Länder.Eine Fiskalunion darf aber nicht einfach nur die Gemeinschaftshaftung ausweiten. Das wäre dann lediglich eine Transferunion, ohne entsprechende Kontrollrechte: Sie würden doch auch nicht mit Ihrem Nachbarn zusammen ein gemeinsames Bankkonto eröffnen, ohne dass Sie seine Ausgaben kontrollieren können - und das Gleiche würde ich natürlich auch Ihrem Nachbarn raten.Eine Fiskalunion erfordert also eine weitreichende Abgabe nationaler Souveränität an die europäische Ebene. Es wären umfassende rechtliche Änderungen in den europäischen Verträgen und auch in den nationalen Verfassungen notwendig. Hier habe ich aber Zweifel, ob der Wille dazu bei Politik und Bevölkerung in Europa zurzeit vorhanden ist.Ein anderer Weg besteht darin, sich wieder auf die Prinzipien des Maastrichter Vertrages zu besinnen, indem man die Eigenverantwortung der Mitgliedstaaten stärker betont. Die Mitgliedstaaten können dann weiter souverän über ihre Verschuldungspolitik entscheiden, müssen aber auch voll dafür haften. Im Extremfall müssten dann auch Staatsinsolvenzen möglich sein, ohne dass dadurch aber Kettenreaktionen ausgelöst werden und das Finanzsystem vor dem Zusammenbruch steht.Die Härtung des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts und die Regelungen für mehr Fiskaldisziplin sind jedenfalls selbst bei strikter Anwendung, wovon derzeit nicht ausgegangen werden kann, keine hinreichende Voraussetzung dafür, Haftungsrisiken umfassend zu vergemeinschaften. Um die Krise dauerhaft zu überwinden, müssen außerdem die besonders von der Krise betroffenen Länder ihren Anpassungs- und Reformkurs fortsetzen.Die Bundesbank hat in ihrem aktuellen Monatsbericht die bereits erzielten Anpassungs- und Reformfortschritte dargestellt. Deutlich gesunkene Lohnstückkosten haben in den meisten der Länder zu einer erheblich verbesserten Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und zu einem Rückgang der hohen Leistungsbilanzdefizite geführt. Außerdem wurden die strukturellen Haushaltsdefizite kräftig reduziert, der Verschuldungsgrad des privaten Sektors verringert und auf dem Arbeitsmarkt wurden überfällige Strukturreformen in Angriff genommen.Insgesamt kann man sagen, der Anpassungsprozess ist in vollem Gang. Einige Länder sind allerdings weiter als andere. Für alle Länder gilt, dass Licht am Ende des Tunnels erkennbar ist. Alle haben aber noch eine entscheidende Wegstrecke vor sich - manche eine kürzere, andere eine längere.Besonders groß ist die Herausforderung nach wie vor für Griechenland; so bestehen im laufenden Hilfsprogramm Finanzierungslücken.Letztlich geht es für die betroffenen Länder darum, sich wirtschafts- und finanzpolitisch so neu aufzustellen, dass sie den Anforderungen der Währungsunion mit ihrer gemeinsamen, stabilitätsorientierten Geldpolitik wieder aus eigener Kraft und dauerhaft gerecht werden.Aber auch in Deutschland gilt es, wirtschaftspolitische Herausforderungen zu meistern. Zwar steht Deutschland - auch dank der Reformen im vergangenen Jahrzehnt - vergleichsweise gut da: Der Staatshaushalt ist ausgeglichen, die Arbeitslosigkeit niedrig, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit hoch. Anlass zur Selbstzufriedenheit besteht aber nicht.Die fortschreitende Globalisierung, die Energiewende, die hohe öffentliche Verschuldung und vor allem der demographische Wandel stellen große Herausforderungen in den nächsten Jahren dar, denen sich die deutsche Politik bereits heute stellen muss.Der Schlüssel zur Bewältigung der Krise im Euro-Raum liegt bei der Politik, nicht bei den Notenbanken. Das Eurosystem hat die Leitzinsen auf ein historisches Tief gesenkt. Zudem wurden umfangreiche außergewöhnliche Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die Liquidität von Banken zu sichern.Die von mir kritisch gesehene Ankündigung der EZB, notfalls unbegrenzt Staatsanleihen von einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten zu kaufen, hat zweifellos zur Beruhigung der Finanzmärkte beigetragen. Die Risikoaufschläge für Staatsanleihen aus den Peripherieländern sind seit 2012 deutlich zurückgegangen.Deshalb wird mir nun häufiger die Frage gestellt, ob dieser Erfolg nicht zeige, dass ich mit meiner Kritik falsch lag; und damit, meine Kritik öffentlich zu machen. Mit der Euro-Krise sei es schließlich wie bei einer geführten Bergwanderung. Wenn dichter Nebel aufzöge, sei es wenig vertrauensbildend, wenn die Bergführer vor der ganzen Gruppe über den richtigen Weg ins Tal stritten.Abgesehen davon, dass in der Euro-Krise nicht die Notenbanken die Bergführer sein sollten, sondern die gewählten Politiker, scheint es mir gerade bei schwierigen Bedingungen wichtig zu sein, besonders sorgfältig über den richtigen Weg nachzudenken.Wie weit sich das Eurosystem mit seiner Ankündigung, notfalls unbegrenzt Staatsanleihen einzelner Staaten kaufen zu wollen, in den Grenzbereich seines geldpolitischen Mandats vorgewagt hat, zeigt auch die Bewertung dieser Ankündigung durch das Bundesverfassungsgericht, das die ökonomischen Bedenken der Bundesbank in weiten Teilen aus seiner juristischen Perspektive teilt.Auch in den derzeit besonders schwierigen Zeiten sollte die Geldpolitik nicht die Reaktion der Finanzmärkte zum Maßstab ihres Handelns machen. Denn sonst würde sie möglicherweise zum Gefangenen der Märkte und dabei Gefahr laufen, bewährte Grundsätze über Bord zu werfen. Ich bin im Übrigen der festen Überzeugung, dass nur eine offene Diskussion über die Vor- und Nachteile verschiedener Maßnahmen die notwendige Voraussetzung für Akzeptanz und Zustimmung in der Bevölkerung schafft.Für mich ist entscheidend, dass wir auch in der Krise nicht die Grundlagen für stabiles Geld in Europa gefährden. Das wäre ein hoher Preis für die Beruhigung der Finanzmärkte.Viele von Ihnen treibt vermutlich ein anderes Thema mindestens genauso um: die derzeitigen Niedrigzinsen.Ich kann die Sorgen und Nöte der Bürger um ihr Erspartes gut verstehen. Sichere Anlagen erwirtschaften gegenwärtig nicht den notwendigen Ertrag zum Werterhalt. Aber die Bürger sind ja nicht nur Sparer, sondern eben auch Arbeitnehmer, Aktionäre oder finanzieren Immobilien per Kredit. Und in dieser Eigenschaft profitieren sie von günstigen Zinsen.Wir dürfen auch nicht vergessen, dass der Euro-Raum den schärfsten Wirtschaftseinbruch seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg hinter sich hat und noch längere Zeit mit den Folgen der Krise kämpfen wird. Das spiegelt sich auch in den derzeit niedrigen Preissteigerungsraten und den gedämpften Inflationsperspektiven wider. Insofern ist auch eine expansive Ausrichtung der Geldpolitik gerechtfertigt.Für mich ist es jedoch wichtig, Sorge dafür zu tragen, dass die extrem niedrigen Zinsen kein Dauerzustand werden. Zumal von der Niedrigzinspolitik auch Risiken ausgehen, die mit der Zeit wachsen. So tun sich zum Beispiel die deutschen Lebensversicherer zunehmend schwer, die zugesagten Garantierenditen zu erwirtschaften, zumal sie aus guten Gründen konservative Anleger sind. Außerdem besteht die Gefahr, dass es zu Blasen an den Finanzmärkten kommt und so die Saat für die nächste Finanzkrise gelegt wird.Technisch sind die Notenbanken jederzeit in der Lage, die geldpolitischen Zügel wieder zu straffen. Die Herausforderung für die Geldpolitik ist gegenwärtig jedoch vor allem politischer Natur. Je mehr sich Politik und Finanzindustrie an das billige Geld gewöhnt haben, je mehr die Geldpolitik als Ersatz für politisches Handeln oder die Anpassung der wirtschaftlichen Strukturen gesehen wird, je mehr die Preise an den Finanzmärkten aufgebläht sind, desto schwieriger wird der Ausstieg aus der ultralockeren Geldpolitik.Die Notenbanken dürfen sich aber von den isolierten Auswirkungen eines Ausstiegs auf die Zinslasten der Staaten oder von den Folgen für Banken und Märkte nicht beirren lassen. Auch beim Ausstieg darf eine auf Preisstabilität ausgerichtete Geldpolitik weder zum Gefangenen der Politik noch der Finanzmärkte werden.Worauf es ankommt ist, dass die Bürger sich darauf verlassen können, dass die Notenbanken Inflationsgefahren und Deflationsgefahren entschlossen entgegentreten.  Wir werden zukünftige Krisen nur dann wirkungsvoll verhindern, wenn dem Haftungsprinzip wieder mehr Geltung verschafft wird - sowohl auf Ebene der Staaten als auch auf Ebene des Finanzsystems.Was die Mitgliedstaaten betrifft, bedeutet eine Stärkung des Haftungsprinzips eine Rückkehr zu mehr Disziplin bei den Staatsfinanzen. Deshalb müssen die gehärteten Regeln des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts und des Fiskalpakts angewandt werden. Und sollte sich ein Mitgliedstaat finanziell doch übernommen haben, sind auch die Bürger des Landes mit in die Verantwortung zu ziehen.Es müssen zukünftig aber auch Staatsinsolvenzen möglich sein, ohne das Finanzsystem im Euro-Raum in den Abgrund zu reißen. In diesen Zusammenhang gehört auch, dass Banken einer strengeren Aufsicht und einer besseren Regulierung unterworfen werden. Insbesondere müssen sie zukünftig im Fall der Fälle abgewickelt werden können. Deshalb benötigen wir den geplanten einheitlichen Restrukturierungs- und Abwicklungsmechanismus in Europa.Es bleibt also noch einiges zu tun, auf dem Weg zu einer langfristig stabilen Währungsunion.Abschließend möchte ich noch eine Dame zitieren, denn Frauen sind heute hier ja leider nicht zu Wort gekommen. Die in Südtirol lebende Schriftstellerin Mary de Rachewiltz hat einmal gesagt, Geld sei der obszöne Doppelgänger des dichterischen Worts.Ihre Begründung: Geld sei ähnlich wie das Dichterwort aus dem Nichts geschaffen, Wortökonomie und Geldökonomie wären auf Maß und Effizienz angewiesen und tendierten doch dazu zu wuchern.Als Notenbanker verstehe ich etwas mehr von der Geldökonomie als von Lyrik, aber so viel habe ich verstanden: Zu viele Worte können genauso inflationär wirken wie zu viel Geld.Deswegen beende ich jetzt meinen Vortrag, danke Ihnen für die Aufmerksamkeit und wünsche uns allen noch einen schönen Abend.",2014-02-14,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-02-14,"Bremen","Germany","470.

"2014-02-18 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Pfandbrief seminar here in Tokyo. It is a pleasure to be here today.When abroad you suddenly become aware of the cultural stereotypes that surround us. And then you realise that all of them are wrong - except for the flattering ones, of course. Regarding Germans, some of the more flattering stereotypes include reliability, punctuality and exactitude. Incidentally, these are also some of the characteristics which make for an extremely good debtor: reliability to repay your debt, punctuality to repay it on time and - maybe most important of all - exactitude to honour the debt and not accidentally forget all about it.In this respect, the Pfandbrief is indeed a typical German financial instrument. It combines all of the virtues I mentioned and its global success shows that it is well-regarded throughout the world.I will offer some thoughts on the Pfandbrief later on. But first, let us take a look at the big picture, as central bankers like to do. To gain an understanding of the Pfandbrief's habitat, I will discuss the current state of the economy in the euro area and in Germany. After all, Pfandbrief cover pools mainly consist of public bonds and mortgages. Thus, the state of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the condition of the German real estate market play an important role for the Pfandbrief.For nearly four years now the debt crisis has been the most relevant issue when debating financial stability in the euro area. And it remains a topic discussed with some concern. Thus, I am delighted that in early 2014 I can offer some good news.The euro area as a whole has finally left recession. By now, we have seen two consecutive quarters of economic growth, 0.1  percent in the third quarter of last year and 0.3  percent in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the outlook for 2014 is quite encouraging. Forecasts are projecting that euro-area GDP will grow by more than 1  percent. And this recovery is not only driven by the so called core countries such as Germany. Some of the crisis-hit countries have also finally embarked on the path to recovery. And those which have not can at least see the light at the end of the tunnel.Take Greece for example, which has been at the centre of the crisis since May 2010. Here, significant progress has been made with regard to structural reforms: unit labour costs have decreased markedly and price competitiveness has improved. Nevertheless, Greece must stay on the path of agreed reforms. In particular, the lag in privatisations should be addressed and the efficiency of public administration needs to be improved.Elsewhere, it also seems that the efforts to implement structural reforms are gradually bearing fruit. True, the high levels of unemployment in many countries paint a gloomy picture and emphasise what a social catastrophe the crisis has been. Nevertheless, the unemployment figures at least appear to be levelling off, and they are already coming down in some countries such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain.In addition, competitiveness has improved in most peripheral countries over the past few years. Almost all of the countries have seen their national unit labour costs fall substantially. Improving competitiveness in turn drives exports higher. All peripheral countries - except Cyprus - are projected to see some export growth this year. These achievements are reflected in current accounts reverting more and more to positive balances.And Germany is part of the rebalancing equation. Since 2007, the intra-euro-area German current account surplus has continuously shrunk from 4½ percent of GDP to 2¼ percent of GDP. This adjustment has been driven by shrinking exports. Furthermore, business investment in Germany is projected to rebound in 2014 and 2015. Thus, the rebalancing should proceed.The progress that these abstract figures reflect is also visible in more concrete events. For example, Ireland and Spain have exited their financial support programmes without any frictions. And Portugal is planning to leave its adjustment programme in the first half of 2014. All three countries have recently accessed the sovereign bond markets at low yields.It seems that international investors increasingly acknowledge the countries' efforts and achievements, which have boosted confidence overall. In the case of Ireland and Portugal, international investors have bought more than 80  percent of the newly issued bonds. I would argue that these developments underscore the impressive progress that the peripheral euro-area countries have made in adjusting their economies.All in all, it is safe to say that the adjustment process is underway, with some countries making more progress than others. A leading group of countries is already within sight of the finishing line, while others still have some way to go. Nonetheless, the peripheral countries still face some challenges. Against this backdrop, it is essential to maintain the momentum and ensure that the necessary reforms are implemented.A country that can justifiably claim to have some experience with reforms is Germany. Not too many years ago, Germany was dubbed the sick man of Europe. But structural reforms have brought the country back on track. The medicine which was decried back then as taking a wrecking ball to the welfare state showed remarkable effect.Of course, reforms in Germany cannot serve as a blueprint for other countries. The structural features of the European economies differ markedly and every country needs a different set of reforms. Nevertheless, the German experience may serve as evidence that reforms do pay off in the end.The reforms also helped Germany to recover rather quickly from the crisis. Indeed, the German economy regained momentum last year and according to all forecasts this upturn will continue. The Bundesbank's economists expect the German economy to expand by 1.7  percent this year and by 2.0  percent in 2015.Admittedly, one of the reasons for the good news I just presented are the extraordinary monetary policy measures the ECB has taken. And there are commentators who propose an even more expansionary monetary policy.They often cite the risk of a Japanese scenario, warning that the euro area faces a fate similar to that of the Japanese economy, which has suffered from the effects of a deflationary trend during the last two decades. But the situations differ greatly.First, the Japanese yen appreciated sharply at the beginning of the 1990s. The result was that import prices receded, acting as a brake on the general price trend. The euro experienced no such strong appreciation during the crisis.Second, deflation requires that nominal wages fall - or at least expand at a slower pace than productivity - over a protracted period of time. In Japan, labour income per employee dropped considerably over many years. In the euro area, no such broad-based development is to be seen. Only in Ireland and Greece has compensation per employee fallen markedly.Fears of a Japanese scenario are therefore misplaced. Moreover, the notion of Japan's lost decades needs to be seen in perspective. The weakness of growth in Japan is partly a natural consequence of the country's demographic change, as the working-age population has been shrinking since the mid-1990s. And that, by the way, is an economic policy challenge that awaits Germany in the years to come.In any case, there are two things we should bear in mind: first, monetary policy can buy time but it cannot buy a solution for the underlying structural problems. Second, a prolonged period of low interest rates and high liquidity provision might sow the seed for new exaggerations and mispricing in some markets.For example, signs of a search for yield are becoming increasingly visible. In corporate debt markets, for instance, valuations already look rather stretched. And in the global low-interest rate environment, ambitious valuations may well spread to other market segments. In this regard, the strong recovery in some countries' property markets should set us thinking.The German housing market is no exception. Between 2009 and 2013, prices in large cities rose by almost 36  percent. And in 2013 they increased by another 8.9  percent. Some indicators already point to overvaluations in urban areas. Nevertheless, when looking at the German market as a whole, the situation seems less dramatic. According to data from the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks - the host of today's seminar - prices rose by around 3.5  percent during the first three quarters of 2013 - a figure that does not appear too exciting. Overall, prices in Germany have not yet moved away from fundamentals.For me, warning bells would start ringing as soon as a rapid increase in housing prices would be accompanied by a significant rise in credit. And even more warning bells would be ringing if this rise in credit was accompanied by deteriorating loan standards. Having said this, I can assure you that at this point in time I am surrounded by silence. We think that macrofinancial risks in this area are rather low for now.All in all, the big picture does not look too bleak. And this is certainly good news for Pfandbrief investors. As the underlying cover pools are mainly composed of government bonds and mortgages, developments in these markets are of fundamental importance to the Pfandbrief. Sound public finances, a healthy housing market and a stable economic environment are the pillars that underpin the reliability of the Pfandbrief. If the Pfandbrief today can boast of a reputation of reliability, it is to a great part because it rests on a solid German state and a sound economy.And it has been resting there for quite some time now. Originally, the German Pfandbrief was introduced over 200 years ago by the Prussian king Frederick II. Frederick's intention was to ease a credit crunch after the Seven Years' War, and with the Pfandbrief he created a financial product of extremely long standing.After more than 200 years of trading experience on the German bond market, the Pfandbrief has gained the trust of investors and a reputation as a secure and crisis-proof investment. In 2012, the size of the Pfandbrief market was some Euro525 billion, which amounts to almost 19  percent of outstanding global covered bonds.The trust in the Pfandbrief also stems from the fact that since 1901, no German Pfandbrief bank has had to declare bankruptcy. But as Frederick II remarked: what is the good of experience if you do not reflect on it? More than 100 years without a single default is certainly an impressive feat. However, we have to reflect on the question of how to continue this accomplishment in the future.We have to acknowledge that during the crisis some Pfandbrief banks encountered difficulties. Hypo Real Estate, for instance, had to be saved with public money. And in the first half of 2009, the Pfandbrief market as a whole was affected to a certain degree when the broader covered bond market experienced significant stress. The intervention of the Eurosystem in the covered bond market certainly helped to ease that stress.In the wake of the financial crisis, though, many sovereigns and banks lost their top ratings. The consequence was widespread downgrades, also in the covered bond market. Many Pfandbriefe were affected and lost their AAA-rating. Nonetheless, their spreads versus risk-free securities did not significantly change, displaying unbroken investor interest and trust.Meanwhile banks have adjusted to the changing conditions. Regarding Mortgage Pfandbriefe cover pools, for instance, overcollateralisation more than doubled. In 2007, assets in these cover pools on average had a value of 116  percent of issued Pfandbriefe. In the third quarter of 2013, the value of cover pools rose to 133  percent.Indeed, overcollateralisation has become all the more important. An obvious reason is that the share of riskier commercial mortgage loans in cover pools has increased steadily to surpass the share of residential mortgage loans. Only recently did this trend appear to reverse again. This reversal is probably linked to individual banks having reconsidered their commercial real estate lending activities outside Germany.All in all, it seems fair to say that the crisis lead to a renaissance of the Pfandbrief. In 2010, a German newspaper described it as the comeback of a bore while Forbes Magazine asserted covered bonds can rebuild America. It seems that the Pfandbrief is a winner of the crisis.Looking to the future, the Pfandbrief might benefit further from crisis-driven regulation. Basel III sees the introduction of global liquidity standards for banks for the first time ever. These new standards will increase the need for secure collateral in the financial system. And Pfandbriefe are eligible assets for the envisaged Liquidity Coverage Ratio and will in all likelihood count as stable funding for the Net Stable Funding Ratio.Likewise, stricter standards for margin requirements on OTCderivative transactions will probably increase collateral usage. Furthermore, the prevalent use of central bank lending against secure collateral underpins demand for collateral in the euro area - at least for the time being. As a consequence, Pfandbriefe, along with other secure collateral, might be increasingly sought after.For participants in the Pfandbrief market, these are certainly positive developments. As a central banker in charge of financial stability, however, I have to take them with a pinch of salt. This is mainly because an increasing amount of assets in banks' balance sheets may get tied up as collateral - a development that has been coined asset encumbrance.Increasing asset encumbrance tends to increase expected losses for unsecured investors should a bank fail. Consequently, unsecured investors are inclined to demand compensation for their more junior position in the debt hierarchy - in effect driving a bigger wedge between secured and unsecured funding costs. As a result, some banks may find it more challenging to meet their overall refinancing needs.Potential problems could also arise in conjunction with policies aimed at bail-ins. If the ratio of encumbered assets rises, bail-in policies could be less effective, as losses would have to be distributed between fewer and fewer unsecured investors.Some argue that to combat the potential effects of higher asset encumbrance we need to introduce widespread limits on covered bond issuance. The objective is to restrict the share of encumbered assets on banks' balance sheets.Indeed, central banks and supervisory authorities need to monitor the matter closely. Nevertheless, I would argue that we should not rush to implement heavy-handed measures, lest we throw the baby out with the bathwater. My argument rests on three pillars.First, most observers agree that there is still an adequate general supply of collateral in the global financial system. Any potential scarcity of collateral may vary by jurisdiction. And different levels of asset encumbrance may well be justified taking into account specific business models of banks. In Germany, for example, there are currently no signs of an increase in asset encumbrance that would worry us. Against this background, it does not seem advisable to introduce international regulation directly aimed at limiting asset encumbrance at the current juncture.Second, incoming regulation already addresses the potential problem of asset encumbrance, albeit somewhat implicitly. Liquidity regulation within Basel III, although accepting covered bonds to a certain extent, at the same time implements a buffer of unencumbered assets. And minimum requirements for bail-inable debt, as foreseen in the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, will likely tackle the issue of asset encumbrance from another angle.Third, collateral shortages could well be a temporary phenomenon. As regards Europe, once the banking system has recovered and bank funding markets have normalised, collateralised funding through the Eurosystem should decrease perceptibly. As a result, demand for collateral would shrink.This last point also illustrates a more general thought: we should focus on the underlying root causes of any excessive encumbrance of assets. Soothing the symptoms alone will not take us forward. In this vein, the ECB's comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets is an important step as is continued support for an orderly deleveraging process of European banks. Both steps should take us a long way towards addressing any adverse effects from asset encumbrance in the financial system.Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to sum up: economic conditions in the euro area are beginning to improve. We finally see the silver lining we have been looking for. Germany, too, is in a good economic condition and will continue to provide a solid economic base for investors.This environment is certainly beneficial for the German Pfandbrief. And looking to the future, the Pfandbrief may further benefit from crisis-driven regulation, especially if safe assets and collateral become even more sought-after. Participants in the Pfandbrief-market understandably welcome this. Central banks and supervisors, however, will closely monitor possible side-effects, such as asset encumbrance in banks' balance sheets. In any case, we should not rush to introduce new legislation, but rather try to tackle the root of the problem.With some satisfaction I would now like to point out that I have finished my opening remarks in time. So, with regard to the virtues of reliability and punctuality, a German central banker and the Pfandbrief indeed seem to have a lot in common.",2014-02-18,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-02-18,"Tokio","Japan","Pfandbrief-Seminar","The euro area, the German economy and the Pfandbrief",2820,16.4,5.1,44.8,11,"EN"
"2014-02-27 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","About six years ago, on 17 February 2008, the British government decided to nationalise Northern Rock. The bank run that preceded this decision was the first run on a British bank in over a century.As we know now, the worst was yet to come. The fall of Lehman Brothers seven months later sent shockwaves through the global economy, marking the onset of what is now known as the Great Recession. Still today, many economies are struggling with the aftermath of the crisis, not only economically, but also socially and politically.The tectonic shifts in financial conditions that erupted so violently took place beneath a seemingly calm macroeconomic surface. Inflation was low and stable, and estimated output gaps were small. Thus, when taking stock of the lessons learned from the crisis, one lesson seems rather straightforward. Price stability is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition to guarantee economic stability. Hence, financial stability has to be in the mix as well.Another lesson the crisis taught us is that, in order to safeguard financial stability, it is not enough if financial regulation and supervision focus on the soundness of individual institutions. The interlinkages between different financial actors and between financial institutions and sovereigns have been a key factor in explaining the crisis.How, then, is financial stability to be maintained? What went wrong in the run-up to the crisis? Have we drawn the right conclusions from what has been the worst financial crisis since the Second World War? And is the implementation of the lessons learned, i.e. the regulatory agenda, proving sufficient to make a similar crisis unlikely?These are the overarching questions of this Bundesbank Symposium. It's a great honour for the Deutsche Bundesbank and a great pleasure for me to welcome you to our symposium, and to see that so many distinguished representatives from academia, central banks, the financial sector, politics, and unions, have accepted our invitation. I am fully aware that some of you - like myself - have come more or less directly from the G20 and BISmeetings held last weekend in Sydney, but I am sure that the lively debate ahead of us on that very relevant topic is the best way to overcome the jetlag.Karl Popper once said that without a free exchange of ideas there can be not freedom of thought. To find out whether our ideas are sound, we need other people to try them out on. This is what this event is all about. So, to kick off our exchange of ideas, let me try out some thoughts on you as to how financial stability might best be achieved.If anybody or anything has actually emerged from the crisis a winner, it is probably the word macroprudential. Microprudential policies such as banking regulation and supervision are still necessary in safeguarding the soundness of individual institutions. But as it turns out, they are not enough when it comes to safeguarding the financial system as a whole. For the management of systemic financial stability risks we need an additional toolkit - macroprudential policies. And it seems to me that this assessment is by now widely shared.The role of monetary policy in this context is, however, still being debated. While macroprudential policy frameworks are still under development, we need to take a stand on whether and how monetary policy should play a supporting role without undermining its pursuit of price stability.First, we have to acknowledge that in the world we live in, macroprudential policy can never be perfectly effective - for instance because safeguarding financial stability is complicated by having to achieve multiple targets all at the same time.While maintaining price stability translates into one single target variable, that is, the average inflation rate related to the price of a consumption basket, maintaining financial stability is more complex. Risks to financial stability can emanate from different sources, such as price bubbles in specific asset markets, but also reckless risk-taking by a single but systemic player, and so on.While the level and volatility in individual prices of goods and services is usually not of much concern to central bankers as long as the impact on the price index is small, the level of and volatility in particular asset prices could lead to instability of the financial sector. This is why preserving financial stability is a multi-dimensional problem.Additionally, financial and business cycles do interact and the monetary policy stance does affect risk-taking by the financial sector. Indeed, some current research supports the view that monetary policy seems to have contributed to the high risk appetite in the financial system and thus to the build-up of financial imbalances.The philosophy of mopping up after a crisis that prevailed in the years before the Great Recession has come under attack because it led to the expectation of a dramatic loosening of monetary policy in the event of a financial crisis. Such an asymmetric policy, in turn, may itself generate an additional incentive to take on higher risks and thus contribute to financial and macroeconomic instability.Hence, some observers argue that price stability and financial stability are so closely intertwined that, in the case of both upturns and downturns, monetary policy has to play an active role in stabilising the financial system. Some even call for a dual mandate for central banks, with financial stability on a par with price stability.But in my view, even if monetary policy instruments were an efficient tool to influence financial stability - a premise which I would still doubt - an important argument against the comprehensive involvement of monetary policy in financial stability lies in the risk of losing credibility with regard to the pursuit of price stability.The credibility of monetary policy depends both on the clarity of its objectives and on transparency with regard to its limitations. Adopting financial stability as an additional monetary policy objective on a par with price stability would risk raising unrealistic expectations about the effectiveness of the monetary policy instruments. It could create trade-offs which would undermine the primacy of the price stability objective, reflected for instance in the form of an inflationary bias.Tasking the central bank with both financial as well as price stability might give rise to a time-inconsistency problem. In such a setting, a central bank should find it optimal to deliver the social optimal level of inflation ex ante, but it might not do so ex post. The time-inconsistency problem may arise because macro-prudential policy is not perfectly effective in preventing financial imbalances and it is only a pre-emptive tool, while monetary policy can pre-empt as well as correct financial imbalances. This is because macroprudential policy can affect only flows of credit but not the outstanding stock of debt. By contrast, monetary policy can also reduce the real stock of debt by creating surprise inflation.Moreover, studies being more optimistic with regard to the efficacy of macroprudential instruments suggest that relying on macroprudential policies for financial stability purposes yields socially more desirable results, because macroprudential instruments allow for a targeted policy response and thus minimise output and inflation volatility.To put it succinctly: when it comes to handling financial stability risks, monetary policy is a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel. So, the latter should be the preferred choice of tool, and getting it ready for use has to be a political top priority.I am therefore convinced that in order to enable monetary policy to fulfil its mandate and to ensure clear accountability, it's important that price stability remains the primary objective of monetary policy. But that is not to say that when it comes to monetary policy and price stability there are no lessons to be learned. Or re-learned, as Claudio Borio has pointed out with the words, Understanding in economics does not proceed cumulatively. … So-called 'lessons' are learnt, forgotten, re-learnt and forgotten again.It is therefore more of a reminder from the crisis than a discovery that monetary policy decisions must attach greater importance to financial sector developments, as risks to financial stability may ultimately culminate in risks to price stability - a topic, I am sure, that will be discussed at greater length during our first session today.Indeed, recent research reaffirms how taking into account credit developments can enhance the stabilisation of the overall economy: output volatility can be dampened without increasing inflation variability. The Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy is in principle rooted in such an approach, as real economic analyses are regularly cross-checked against those from monetary analyses. Nonetheless, the Eurosystem has stepped up its efforts to continually enhance its monetary analysis, including early warning indicators for unsound developments in the financial markets.In this context, I would like to stress that what I call a more symmetric monetary policy approach of the Eurosystem is not identical to a prototypical approach of leaning against the wind. Roughly speaking, a leaning against the wind strategy can be seen as an unconditional monetary policy response to asset price changes.  In contrast, a more symmetric monetary policy advocates a conditional policy response.By this I mean that in the context of our monetary analysis, we identify longer-term risks to price stability based on money and credit developments. The critical condition is therefore whether asset price movements and credit developments give rise to monetary and financial imbalances, which are ultimately relevant for price stability.In this sense, our monetary analysis acts as a filter to extract the monetary policy relevant movements in financial markets. This prevents us from being myopic, helps us to conduct monetary policy more symmetrically across the financial cycle and thereby contributes to overall financial stability - but always on the basis of our price stability objective.However, fundamental challenges remain with this approach. As Claudio Borio has pointed out, the financial cycle has a much lower frequency than the traditional business cycle. Since financial liberalisation, its typical length is of the order of 16 to 20 years; by contrast, as generally conceived in academic and policy work, business-cycle frequencies are up to eight years. So, while extending the monetary policy decision-making horizon is warranted in principle, we are restricted in practice by our limited ability to reliably forecast over longer horizons. For instance, early warning indicators might perform well ex post, but do not necessarily exhibit the same performance ex ante.We certainly need to look into all of these issues in more detail - I am looking forward to our discussion on these topics today. When it comes to financial stability, monetary policy has a role to play - insofar as price stability is at risk as well. But macroprudential policies, with their more versatile and precise instruments, should provide the first line of defence against financial instability. In many cases, the interest rate will prove too crude an instrument with which, for instance, to prick asset bubbles.But it is not only the macroeconomic toolbox that needs an overhaul. The crisis has laid bare structural shortcomings of the financial system. These structural flaws demand a structural - that is, a regulatory - answer.Market failures and regulatory blind spots have tilted the playing field, hampered competition, and over-stimulated the risk appetite of investors. As you all know, much effort has already been taken to address the fault lines revealed by the global financial crisis and to move towards a more resilient global financial system.At its meeting in Sydney last weekend the G20 agreed, to focus  its current work programme on 1) building resilient financial institutions, 2) ending too big to fail, 3) addressing shadow banking risks, and 4) making derivatives markets safer. To be more concrete, I would like to revert to one key characteristic of the financial market that also regulation failed adequately to take into account in the past: the interconnectedness of its players.One of the main characteristics of financial institutions is that the failure of one institution might pull others down with it and cause a systemic crisis if the failing institution has, because of its size, a significant influence on financial markets or its business partners or does business with a lot of partners.  The term too interconnected to fail might therefore be even more appropriate for this well-known too big to fail problem.The insolvency of Lehman Brothers that I mentioned earlier is a case in point. What was lacking then was an insolvency framework that allowed the failure of this institution without destabilising the entire financial system. More than five years after the Lehman insolvency, the too big to fail problem still poses a real threat.Work has been under way to transpose the Financial Stability Board's Key attributes of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions into national law, but we are not there yet, and we must not slacken in our effort - for instance to ensure that G-SIFIs have sufficient resources available to absorb losses in resolution, or to develop resolution rules for financial institutions of other sectors as well, such as insurers.In Europe, one major bit of progress is undoubtedly the agreement on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. The directive sets forth resolution instruments and the sequence of liability for failing banks. In future, shareholders and creditors will be first in line to bear the costs of bank failures - rightfully so, since they assumed the risks and benefited from the respective returns in the first place.Containing the challenge of interconnectedness implies the necessity, first, to increase the loss absorbing capacity of institutions, thus making them less likely to fail to begin with and, second, to limit counterparty exposure. In the end, both ways also lead to a better balance of liability and control, which is crucial for the correct functioning of financial markets and, hence, for financial stability.The new Basel III international capital rules increase the loss absorbing capacity of banks because they now have to hold more and better capital than before. But to some, the risk-weighted approach of the Basel rules is fundamentally flawed.Critics such as Martin Hellwig, who will elaborate on his views during tomorrow's panel discussion on banking regulation, maintain that the Basel approach causes the rules to miss substantial risks. And he argues that banks are using the risk weightings to leverage their positions up to a hundred times the equity invested.Still, the reasoning behind risk weighting sounds plausible. If all assets had to be backed by the same level of capital, banks would have an incentive to opt for riskier investments, as this would raise their expected return on equity. This, of course, would do a disservice to financial stability.Mark Carney therefore has argued for a pragmatic approach: sometimes you need both a belt and suspenders if you are at risk of losing your pants. Hence, the risk-weighted Basel rules should be supplemented by an unweighted leverage ratio.In my opinion, that sounds sensible. To economists, parsimony is normally key when it comes both to economic modelling and to regulatory proposals. But in this special case, putting multiple safety measures in place might be justified, even necessary. What applies to power stations holds for the financial system as well. When the potential fallout is vast, redundancy, not parsimony, might be the better approach - a point, I am sure, we will have time to delve into further during tomorrow's panel discussion on regulatory reforms.It is obvious, however, that stricter regulation for some institutions might shift business to less regulated players. Regulators need to take this aspect of interconnectedness into account, too. The so-called shadow banking system can be a source of systemic risk because of unregulated liquidity and maturity transformation, the build-up of leverage, and procyclicality.The FSB published policy recommendations to address specific risks emanating from certain activities or institutions. In order to identify new risks in due time, the FSB has established a regular monitoring exercise. These are steps in the right direction.For the international recommendations to be effective, it is crucial to transpose them consistently into national law - and to do so quickly, given that this issue has been on the agenda for quite a while. In Europe, for instance, we are already in the process of implementing international recommendations to regulate money market funds and to enhance the transparency of securities financing transactions.Finally, there is yet another major aspect of interconnectedness that regulators have not taken into account up to now: the link between banks' balance sheets and public finances. The financial crisis has shown that if a systemically relevant bank or many banks simultaneously run into financial difficulties, the stability of the financial system is put at risk as a result. Given the deficiencies of previous resolution regimes, governments often had no option but to step in and bail out banks to prevent the financial system from collapsing.In Europe, however, the Greek case in particular showed that the other way round can also be of relevance. Difficulties in government finances might cause substantial problems for banks, in particular because many banks hold large portfolios of government bonds.From a financial stability viewpoint this vicious circle has to be broken. As I discussed earlier, resolution regimes for banks are important in this regard. Having credible resolution frameworks in place with clear bail-in rules of shareholders and creditors would help to shield the government from having to rescue banks with taxpayers' money.Another crucial measure to cut the sovereign-banking nexus refers to the regulatory capital requirement regime for banks. One of the key lessons of the crisis was that sovereign bonds cannot per se be considered risk-free. We should therefore put this regulatory fiction to rest.But sovereign bonds pose a threat to financial stability not only because of preferential risk-weighting. The most important rule in risk management is diversification. Yet when it comes to sovereign bonds, banks all too often seem to neglect this principle. In many cases, European banks hold bonds from one sovereign only - their home country. Large and undiversified sovereign exposure is what makes sovereign default a potentially systemic event. Hence, the large exposure regime which caps the investment in one single debtor has to be applied to sovereigns as well.Without addressing the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures, I see no reliable way of breaking the sovereign-banking nexus. In my view, such regulations are an indispensable prerequisite for a healthy financial system in the longer run.Ladies and gentlemen, let me now come to a close.The challenges I have just described make one thing very clear: safeguarding financial stability is truly a herculean task. It would therefore be an understandable reflex to summon all policies at our disposal towards that end. As D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis would have said: All for one, and one for all!But while indeed all the policies I have mentioned - microprudential, macroprudential, and monetary policy - have a role to play when it comes to securing financial stability, some restraint seems to be in order, especially with regard to monetary policy.Monetary policy can influence financial conditions. Notably, it can, to a certain extent, influence the risk-taking behaviour of the financial sector. A more symmetric monetary policy that looks through the financial cycle therefore seems appropriate. Monetary policy has to counter financial imbalances inasmuch as they endanger price stability.But adopting financial stability as an additional monetary policy objective on a par with price stability overstates the accuracy and the effectiveness with which monetary policy can contribute to financial stability. And ultimately it runs the risk of harming credibility with regard to the pursuit of price stability, as this depends on both monetary policy clarity regarding its objectives and transparency regarding its limitations.This implies, however, that we must continue in our efforts to fully develop macroprudential policy as soon as possible; and that the international recommendations on financial regulation have to be transposed quickly and consistently into national law.",2014-02-27,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-02-27,"Frankfurt","Germany","Symposium der Deutschen Bundesbank","All for one and one for all?

"2014-02-28 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","I am delighted to have the pleasure of concluding this first Bundesbank symposium on financial stability and the role of central banks.In ancient Greece, the word symposium described a social gathering with food and drink. I hope you all enjoyed our symposium in the truest sense of the word at our official dinner yesterday evening.Overall, our symposium was geared more heavily towards the modern meaning of the word symposium, which refers to conferences as a forum for exchanging information. Over the course of two days, this symposium provided a platform for debate between senior policymakers, central bankers, supervisors, academics and financial sector professionals.I am very pleased that so many distinguished guests accepted our invitation to participate in this event. The diverse background and the extensive experience of the keynote speakers, panellists and participants allowed us to cover a lot of territory. Thanks to your outstanding participation and lively discussions we were all able to benefit from an intensive exchange of thoughts and ideas.George Bernard Shaw is said to have made a notable remark on the benefits of exchanging ideas. He said: If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.I think those words perfectly capture the intention and the outcome of our two-day symposium. Ideas multiply when you share them and they become better when you discuss them.In this spirit, the symposium addressed the overarching question of how to maintain financial stability - a topic that has acquired the centre stage in the public policy debate since the outbreak of the global crisis.The crisis has taught us a number of lessons. One of the most important lessons in my view is that monetary policy and financial stability cannot be viewed as independent concerns.Monetary policy cannot function properly in an environment of financial instability. Financial stability is a necessary prerequisite for an effective monetary policy because crises threaten the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.Conversely, price stability is a necessary precondition for maintaining financial stability. But this alone is not sufficient. Safeguarding financial stability is a multi-dimensional problem because systemic risks may arise from a variety of sources and can be transmitted through various channels. Asset price bubbles and excessive risk-taking by systemic players serve as just two examples.Another key lesson to be learned from the crisis is that regulators need to consider the financial system as a whole. From a financial stability viewpoint, it is not enough to focus on the soundness of individual institutions. While it is true that enhancing the resilience of individual institutions does make them less likely to fail, the possibility of allowing an institution to become insolvent cannot - and in a market economy must not - be ruled out completely. If a large or interconnected institution fails, it might drag down other institutions with it and trigger a systemic crisis. To mitigate systemic risks, we need to complement microprudential regulation and supervision by adding a systemic, that is, a macroprudential view.Adopting a systemic view also means extending the regulatory framework beyond banks. Stricter regulatory requirements in one sector might lead to business being shifted into other sectors. To avoid such regulatory arbitrage, regulation needs to encompass all the markets, products and participants involved in the financial system.Finally, let me say that regulation will always only be as good as its implementation. I would like to give you an example. While we are preparing for a single banking supervision in Europe, there still is no final agreement on a resolution mechanism. But how can a European supervisory body be credible if it cannot resolve a bank when necessary? Thus, I appeal to those involved in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the European Single Resolution Mechanism prior to the European elections in May.What I consider crucial in a more general context is the timely and consistent transposition of international recommendations on regulation into national law. With diverging or inconsistent national approaches we would risk counteracting the internationally agreed reforms or possibly eventually even render them ineffective.Ladies and gentlemenLet me conclude. The leading question of our symposium was how to maintain financial stability. The answer to such a complex question is of course not a simple one. Over the last two days we have exchanged many thoughts and ideas on financial stability, its interplay with monetary policy and the appropriate role for central banks. So I do hope that George Bernard Shaw was right and that everybody leaves this symposium with new ideas on how to reach our common goal of safeguarding financial stability.Let me say what a great pleasure it has been for me to be here with you. I have very much enjoyed listening to your presentations and discussing your ideas. And for that, I would like to thank you all. I wish to particularly extend my gratitude to the panellists, panel chairs and keynote speakers whose efforts helped to make this symposium a success. And, last but not least, I would like to thank all my colleagues at the Bundesbank who made this symposium possible in the first place.",2014-02-28,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-02-28,"Frankfurt","Germany","Symposium der Deutschen Bundesbank","Concluding remarks",889,18.8,5.1,39.7,12.3,"EN"
"2014-03-10 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for inviting me to speak at the American Academy in Berlin. As you may know, I was born in the United States and still carry a US passport in addition to my German one. And this is why I very much appreciate the work of the Academy in fostering dialogue between the United States and Germany, and why I wholeheartedly support Gary Smith and his team.In general, a dialogue based on trust and mutual understanding is essential in order to master challenges and solve problems. However, trust and mutual understanding do not always come naturally. What I am thinking of is the world of finance. Over the past years, people around the world have lost trust in the financial system in general and in banks in particular.This lack of trust is not only reflected by rather sobering polling results; it is also reflected by what people on the street are saying. Just the other day I heard a short remark that was intended as a joke but, to my ears, certainly did not sound like one. It went like this: “An honest criminal becomes a bank robber. A dishonest criminal becomes a bank manager.”Although I do not subscribe to the message, this remark does capture the general mood rather well. And this sentiment should not come as a surprise to us. We have lived through a succession of crises for almost seven years now. Banks and the financial system have, unfortunately, been at the heart of each of these crises.Against this backdrop, everyone agrees that we have to reshape the world of finance. Regarding the banks, change has to come from within and from without. A change in culture is what must come from within, and from without must come a reform of regulation.But we also have to look beyond the banks. The first thing that comes to mind is the link between banks and the state. The crisis in the euro area has emphasised how closely the fates of banks and states are intertwined. To break this link, further reforms are important and they are necessary.Finally, we have to acknowledge that the financial system comprises more than just banks. There are other players that can become a source of risks to financial stability, to the economy, to taxpayers’ money and to our wealth.But let us begin by taking a look at the banks.Leaving aside all the nitty-gritty, there is one thing I believe we should do: we have to bring more market to the financial market. This may sound counterintuitive at first. Some of you may ask: “Even more market? Wasn’t liberalisation what brought us these problems in the first place?” My answer to this question is that I am not talking about liberalisation but about the fundamental principle of a market economy.This principle is the ever-important principle of liability. Everywhere it is common sense that people should be held responsible for their actions. Everywhere but in the world of banking, it appears to some critics. During the crisis, governments around the world spent billions of dollars out of taxpayers’ pockets to save the banks. At the same time, many companies in the real economy failed and exited the market.Why is it that banks seem to play by a different set of rules? Are they not being held responsible for their actions? Are they staying in the market even if they have unsuccessful business models?The answer can be found in a concept that is sometimes labelled “systemic relevance” and sometimes “too big to fail”. Now, what does it mean when a bank is systemically relevant or “too big to fail”?In essence, it means that the bank in question is very big or very interconnected. It is woven so deeply into the fabric of the financial system that its failure might bring down the system. The most prominent example is the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. This event marked the beginning of the global financial crisis we are still in.The consequence of “too big to fail” is this: whenever a big or interconnected bank gets into trouble, the government might be compelled to bail it out in order to avoid a full-blown financial crisis. This means that these banks have an implicit insurance. Whatever happens, the government is likely to stand ready to help.Thus, these banks indeed play by a different set of rules. And this has consequences for the nature of the game. The implicit insurance provides incentives to engage in risky business that promises high returns. If things turn out well, the bank wins. If things go wrong, the taxpayers lose.The principle of liability is violated, and we have returned to the point where my argument began. The crucial question at this point is: what do we need to do in order to restore the principle of liability?The decisive point is that banks must be able to fail without dragging down the entire financial system with them. To this end, a new international standard on the recovery and resolution of systemically relevant banks has been developed. Having this new standard is a major step forward.At the same time, a Single Resolution Mechanism will be a central pillar of the European banking union. It will allow authorities to restructure or resolve banks without putting taxpayers’ money at stake. The owners of the bank and the creditors will be the first in line when it comes to bearing the costs of a bank failure.Due to its importance, let me stress how crucial it is that those involved in the negotiations reach an agreement on the European Single Resolution Mechanism prior to the European elections in May. A European banking supervision cannot be effective without a European resolution mechanism.In the same context, the Comprehensive Assessment is crucial as a precondition for a successful banking union. The objective is to uncover any legacy assets in banks’ balance sheets and to assess their resilience to stress scenarios. With that objective in mind, the Asset Quality Review and the stress test have to be tough and thorough. This will ensure that European supervision and European resolution mechanisms do not have to deal with problems that arose under national supervision.Aligning the banking sector with the principles of a market economy will take us a big step towards financial stability. But it won’t take us all the way. To safeguard the stability of the entire financial system, we have to look beyond the banks.One issue we definitely have to address is the connection between banks and the public sector. The banking system is closely linked with public finances. This link was a major driver of the crisis in the euro area. So, let us now take a closer look at the link between banks and states.When the financial crisis unfolded and banks everywhere ran into difficulties, governments had to step in to avoid a breakdown of the entire financial system. This experience is a real world example of the “too big to fail” problem which I discussed a moment ago.However, saving banks is a costly endeavour for governments. Let’s take Ireland as an example. In order to save its banking sector, Ireland ran up a budget deficit amounting to 30 percent of its economic output in 2010. In the same year, Germany added almost euro 33 billion to its public deficit as a consequence of supporting the banking system.Obviously, saving banks puts a lot of strain on public finances. And this brings us to the other side of the vicious circle.When public finances run into difficulties, the banks are put under strain. Fiscal distress is particularly problematic for those banks that hold government bonds. And it was mainly banks in the crisis countries as well as in Italy and Spain which bought up large volumes of domestic government debt - even during the crisis.At the end of January, Italian banks’ exposures to the Italian general government amounted to almost 10 percent of their total assets. The equivalent figure for Spanish banks was almost 9 percent. And it was chiefly weaker banks that bought up sovereign debt.Altogether, the link between banks and states is so close that it can easily become a vicious circle. To preserve financial stability we have to break through this vicious circle from two sides. We have to protect public finances from banks running into difficulties and, vice versa, we have to protect banks from public finances running into difficulties.Regarding the first objective, I have already sketched out the solution. We need resolution mechanisms that allow us to resolve and restructure banks without placing the financial burden on public finances. As I said before, we also need them in Europe, and as soon as possible.Regarding the second objective, we also have to revert to regulation. We have to adapt regulatory requirements in order to protect banks from government finances running into difficulties.If we are looking to offer banks greater protection against distressed public finances, it is government bonds we must target. From the perspective of regulation, there are two factors which play a role here.The first factor concerns banks’ capital. Under the current regime, banks do not need to hold capital against the risks of loans to sovereigns - unlike other loans. This regime is based on the assumption that loans to governments are risk-free because states cannot default. And, if no losses can develop, it is not necessary to establish capital buffers.All those who had trouble following this line of argument saw their doubts confirmed by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Whether we like it or not, we obviously need to rethink the assumption that loans to governments are risk-free.Consequently, it appears urgently necessary to change the rules. If banks were required to hold capital against the risks of their government bond portfolios, this would make them more resilient to fiscal distress. At the same time, banks would have an incentive not to buy such large volumes of government bonds.And this brings us to the second issue: capital alone is insufficient. A crucial tool of risk management is diversification. The rule of thumb is never put all your eggs in one basket. A cap on loans to an individual sovereign should therefore also be introduced.Such caps have already been a fact of life for loans to the private sector for some time. They prevent banks from becoming overexposed to a single borrower. This makes them less vulnerable to the default of that borrower - and this is needed not just for private borrowers but for government borrowers as well.Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked about banks and I have talked about states. But to reshape the world of finance we have to reach further than that. The world of finance comprises more than just banks.Consider the insurance sector. Just one day after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the US government had to invest more than $180 billion to bail out the insurer AIG - another institution that was deemed “too big to fail”. Five years later, the regulation of systemically relevant insurers is far less advanced than it is for banks. A relevant framework is slowly emerging, but some of the groundwork has only recently been prepared.And there are other sectors we have to look out for. There are areas of bank-like business that are still outside the perimeter of banking regulation. These areas are usually referred to as the shadow banking system. In my view, this term is somewhat misleading and unfair. It implies that institutions operating in the shadow banking system are somewhat shady in character - and that is definitely not the case.In general, the shadow banking system provides an alternative source of funding and is therefore associated with diversification and specialisation benefits. Their funds are, in principle, very much welcomed in the context of the Comprehensive Assessment.Nevertheless, institutions in the shadow banking system perform bank-like activities and incur bank-like risks without being subject to bank regulation. And these risks can certainly be systemic because of unregulated liquidity and maturity transformation, because of the build-up of leverage, and because of pro-cyclicality.We therefore will have to make sure that such entities and activities are adequately monitored and regulated. This objective is high on the agenda of the G20, and we have already made good progress. Nevertheless, quite some work still lies ahead.Ladies and gentlemen, reshaping the world of finance is certainly an ambitious objective. And it is an objective that can only be reached if we all work together. The world of finance is a global issue, and reshaping it requires global cooperation.Against this backdrop, recent regulatory initiatives in the US such as the enhanced standards for bank holding companies and foreign banking organisations worry me. They seem to contradict the need for international cooperation. Balkanisation of regulation is a real risk and any regulatory decision should be taken with that consideration in mind - in Europe as well as in the United States.But not only do we need cooperation between authorities of different countries. In my speech, I have mainly discussed how to reform regulation. But there is one thing we should be aware of: we cannot solve all of our problems through regulation. In order to reshape the world of finance, change has also to come from within.Financial stability begins in the hearts and minds of those who work in finance: investment bankers, stock market brokers, hedge fund managers and everyone who invests other people’s money. What we need is a change of culture. The times of “greed is good” should be left far behind us. I am not at all against ambition, but short-termism and greed need to be stopped. We should see the financial system for what it is: a service provider for the real economy.And again we have to look beyond the banks. Especially in Europe, companies tend to rely on bank loans as a source of funding. Here, it would be beneficial to diversify by turning more to the capital markets as an alternative source of funds. A more diversified funding mix would improve companies’ access to funding in normal times as well as in crisis times.Reshaping the world of finance is certainly a big step towards a stable financial system and a prosperous real economy. In a more European context, it is an equally big step towards our common goals of a stable monetary union and a stable euro.And the economic advantages of a single currency will benefit all the member states - including Germany. But I urge you not to think about the euro only in economic categories. As long ago as 1950, the French economist Jacques Rueff noted that Europe will be made through the currency or not at all. The euro is not only an economic project. It is also a political project. It is an important building block of a united Europe.Thus, the issues I have raised in my speech tonight serve a range of objectives; and each of them is worth pursuing with ambition.",2014-03-10,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-03-10,"Berlin","Germany","American Academy","The euro, the banks and the crisis - Reshaping the world of finance",2527,15.7,4.7,56,9.3,"EN"
"2014-03-17 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","The International Business Cycle Conference has become a firm fixture within an institution that is itself very much a fixture of the German economics landscape. Truly international in its focus from the start, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy has nevertheless shaped the national economic discourse like few other institutions have done.Over the last hundred years, its global perspective, research quality and policy relevance have made it one of Germany’s leading economic research institutes. And to me, this sounds like a formula for success in the 21st century as well. I am therefore grateful for the invitation and for the opportunity to speak here today.Analysing international developments and Germany’s role in them is the Kiel Institute’s core competence. But as the English writer Charles Caleb Colton once pointed out, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So let me celebrate the Kiel Institute’s centenary by having a go at analysing international developments, and Germany’s role in them, myself.In the next 25 minutes or so, I wish to present my take on the external imbalances in the euro area and Germany’s role in this context. In particular, I will be focussing on three points: that compared to a fixed exchange rate regime, the adjustment pressure of a deficit country in a currency area is cushioned by the single monetary policy, avoiding excessive adjustment costs, but which also calls for additional rules; that stimulating German demand cannot be a substitute for removing rigidities in the deficit countries, but that strengthening Germany’s growth potential, for instance by increasing competition in the services sector, will be helpful with regard to the current account as well; that due to its demographics and degree of economic development, Germany’s role as a capital exporter is unlikely to change, which means that, to a certain extent, German surpluses are here to stay.Let me start by taking a closer look at the role of external imbalances in a monetary union.In the early stages of European economic and monetary union, interest rates in the member states converged at a low level following the elimination of exchange rate risk. From the perspective of deeper economic and financial market integration, this was desirable in principle.However, the favourable financing conditions in the euro-area countries with previously higher interest rates stimulated their domestic demand. A procyclical real interest rate effect then ensued. Higher domestic demand led to above-average inflation in the respective countries, while nominal interest rates hardly differed across the euro area, causing real interest rates to fall even further in the countries concerned.At the same time, higher demand caused wages to rise as well, which pushed the real exchange rate up and reduced price competitiveness. But the dampening effect on exports due to the rise in the real exchange rate did not suffice to moderate wage developments in the countries concerned. In other words, the interest rate effect dominated the exchange rate effect. Consequently, worsening exports did not trigger adjustment, and current account deficits continued. As a result, the deficit countries built up ever-larger external liabilities.However, large external debts, especially when funded through short-term financing, can exacerbate existing national dysfunctions and vulnerabilities. This is precisely what happened in some peripheral euro-area countries during the current crisis: they could no longer finance their deficits through private capital inflows, requiring macroeconomic rebalancing. And this is precisely what I would call a balance of payments crisis: a sudden stop in the inflow of private capital that requires a correction of unsustainable developments and policies.The reason for the sudden stop in private capital inflow was a loss in creditors’ confidence in countries’ solvency. In this context, financial markets appeared to recall one important, and hitherto ignored, institutional aspect of the European monetary union: the no-bail out clause. No euro-area country or a European institution is allowed to finance the debt of another euro-area country.Prior to the current crisis, the possibility of national balance of payments crises occurring in a monetary union like the European one was largely discarded in economic policy discussions. It was believed that individual countries within a monetary union and as part of a single money and capital market would no longer experience funding shortages after exchange rate risk had been eliminated.In fact, it was long deemed unnecessary to even analyse national balances of payments, as it was thought that a single currency area would prevent balance of payments crises from occurring in individual member states.As we know now, this theory proved incorrect. Although the balance of payments is an ex-post accounting record, from an economic perspective it expresses an important budget constraint: deficits need to be financed.Furthermore, the current crisis has shown that national imbalances can create significant contagion effects in a monetary union. In this regard, financial integration has proved a double-edged sword: while it deepened funding reservoirs in good times, the increased interconnectedness also served to propagate shocks far more strongly than before, creating new vulnerabilities.In the end, to prevent financial stability risks in the euro area from materialising, public funds were used to substitute the drained private funds to finance the deficits: first, through intergovernmental loans or through the European rescue funds, that is the EFSF and the ESM; and second, through refinancing operations of the Eurosystem with banks in the peripheral countries; a point to which I will return later.It is a well-known fact that in a fixed exchange rate regime, the national central bank can, at least in the short term, choose between directly intervening by selling foreign currency and raising its key interest rate in order to uphold the exchange rate. This is precisely what we have seen recently in some emerging market countries.Both of these measures produce a squeeze in the domestic money supply and therefore in credit demand, which ultimately reduces the demand for goods and services in the real economy. In the long run, sustainability is restored through the imposed reduction of relative prices and wages.In contrast to balance of payments crises under fixed exchange rate regimes, the adjustment process in the euro area is cushioned and protracted by the single monetary policy through harmonised short-term interest rates and liquidity assistance measures of the Eurosystem.This means that the national stock of money in circulation in an individual deficit country is not generally reduced to the same extent as private net capital outflows. Instead, commercial banks can cover their existing financing needs via greater refinancing from the central bank - at least if they have sufficient collateral and if the central bank has no limit in place for the stock of refinancing credit.This is precisely the fixed-rate full allotment policy the Eurosystem introduced in 2008 to safeguard the liquidity of the euro-area banking system after the common European money market had encountered severe strains. As a result, there is no monetary policy pressure to adjust prices and wages. Indeed, empirical studies carried out by the Bundesbank staff have confirmed that current account adjustments take longer in a monetary union than in fixed exchange rate regimes. One could say that the common monetary policy acts as an anti-lock braking system (ABS). It prevents the funding of external deficits from coming to a screeching halt. But a balance of payments crisis is a bumpy ride on a rough surface, and under these conditions an ABS prolongs rather than shortens the braking distance. That is why rally cars do not have ABS. In other words, economic adjustment risks stalling. But policy room for manoeuvre might be limited in a crisis and the long-term functioning of the monetary union risks being further undermined by the crisis and by attempts to cope with it - as we saw recently. Some crisis measures tilted further the balance between control and liability and monetary policy came under pressure to ease the impact of the crisis on banks and states.With regard to short-term crisis management, however, it is essential to keep monetary policy and fiscal policy segregated. In a crisis, central banks play an important role as lenders of last resort to solvent banks. This involves short-term refinancing operations in return for high-quality collateral.Every support measure for a financial institution that goes clearly beyond this means that the central bank is performing a quasi-fiscal role. Measures like financial aid to insolvent banks or the take-over of banks’ balance sheet risks rightly belong in the domain of parliaments and elected governments.Only parliaments and elected governments have the democratic legitimacy needed to redistribute risks between euro-area countries. If central banks were to perform a quasi-fiscal role, they risk becoming dominated by fiscal policy, which could undermine their ability to maintain price stability.To avoid such a situation, it is important to prevent the build-up of imbalances. Hence, additional safety systems in the form of pre-emptive rules are essential.In the first place, excessive public deficits have to be avoided by strict deficit rules. Such rules were introduced by the Stability and Growth Pact even before the euro was introduced. Unfortunately, these rules were not enforced strictly enough; they were violated more than once, not least by Germany and France.In response to the crisis, the rules were stiffened. But the procedure became overly complex and affords considerable political leeway. And so far, the Commission's interpretation has been rather lenient, undermining the binding effect of the new rules.Additionally, greater economic policy surveillance is crucial. The macroeconomic surveillance procedure is instrumental in detecting and counteracting unhealthy economic developments.But while safety systems are important, we also need to strengthen the chassis of the monetary union itself.The balance of payments results from the interplay of international trade and investment decisions. It’s not a case of the capital account passively following the current account: both interact through interest rate and price signals. Distortions can therefore originate from both sides, as indeed happened in the run-up to the current crisis. Capital has not always been put to its most productive use. And structural rigidities have hampered adjustment through a shift from the non-tradable to the tradable sector, and curbed growth potential.Regarding the removal of rigidities in product and labour markets, reforms are now underway. Unit labour costs of deficit countries have fallen as a result, and current accounts have improved - not only because of shrinking imports, but because of expanding exports as well.Factors of production are being reallocated to sectors with a strong focus on exports. The construction sector in Ireland accounted for over half the decrease in aggregate employment; in Spain, Italy and Portugal, it accounted for around two-fifths. In industry, by contrast, either far fewer jobs have been cut or - as in Ireland - new jobs have recently been created.Real value added, in particular, already far exceeded its pre- crisis level in the export-intensive information and communication sector in Spain and Ireland in 2012. In Ireland, other business-related services also showed substantial growth. Compared to its pre-crisis level, real value added in trade and tourism increased in Portugal and remained virtually unchanged in Spain.These sectoral differences are also reflected in credit reallocation, e.g. in Spain. While loans to the Spanish construction sector fell, the more productive export-oriented industrial sector is able to receive loans. This aspect is often forgotten when discussing credit growth in periphery countries.Progress has been uneven, though, and further reforms are needed to facilitate this shift from the non-tradable to the tradable sector and, therefore, to strengthen sustainable growth.What is also important, however, is that the banking systems in some euro-area countries haven’t correctly fulfilled their economic function. And the national banking supervisory authorities have intervened too little, and too late.Providing for a more stable financial system and contributing to a more efficient allocation of capital are the ultimate goals of the banking union, which will consist of a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and a Single Restructuring and Resolution Mechanism (SRM).To prevent future financial crises, an effective restructuring and resolution regime is of the essence. A functioning resolution regime with a credible bail-in of shareholders and creditors strengthens incentives for effective credit monitoring and moderates banks’ risk appetites. In so doing, it reduces the risk that, in the event of future bank failures, taxpayers are again the first line of defence. This will enhance the allocation of capital and reduce the risk of a bubble emerging.However, the euro area comprises not only balance of payments deficit countries but surplus countries as well, most prominently Germany. Germany’s surplus vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area has fallen as a mirror-image of the improvements in deficit countries. Last year, it was about half of its previous high.Nevertheless, there have been repeated calls for German competitiveness to be lowered to reduce the imbalances in the euro area. One possible solution that has been suggested is a considerable hike in German wages - in other words, a larger increase than is warranted by conditions on the domestic labour market.The idea behind this is that competitiveness is relative: one country’s loss is another country’s gain. In terms of the euro area, however, this would only work if the euro area were an island in the world economy and not competing with the outside world. Correspondingly, estimates we have carried out show that the results of such a policy would disappoint.In our estimates we assumed an additional wage increase in Germany of 2 percentage points above what would normally be expected as the outcome of wage bargaining. Then we used our economic models to calculate the effect such an increase would have on the exports of peripheral euro-area countries.Given the nature of the trade flows between Germany and peripheral countries, the effect there would be close to zero. Only Ireland could expect a moderate lift. By contrast, Germany’s economy would suffer. Depending on the model, employment would ultimately fall by as much as 1 percent, and output by ¾ percent.And a credit-financed increase in public spending would spur exports of peripheral countries even less. The import share of German public demand is only 9 percent, less than half of the import share of private demand at 21 percent and less than a quarter of the import share of German exports at just under 41 ½  percent.Fundamentally, Germany’s surplus is not due to distortions, but the result of market processes. As the European Commission pointed out in its recently published In-Depth Review, the surplus is the result of an interplay of various factors and developments in Germany as well as globally and among its euro-area partners which affected savings and investment in the domestic economy.Germany’s post-reunification situation was marked by high unit labour costs and high unemployment. To bring real wages down to a market clearing level, a period of wage moderation ensued. This, combined with the realisation that demographic developments would require greater private savings to ensure a comfortable retirement, has caused the saving rate of households to rise gradually over the last decade.A similar picture holds for the development of corporate savings. At the turn of the millennium, German companies were highly leveraged. At the same time, regulatory and tax incentives made equity more attractive by comparison. Both developments led companies to scale back investment and bolster their equity positions by retaining earnings - to a point where savings actually exceeded investment, an oddity as far as the corporate sector is concerned.While both household and corporate savings rose, overall investment remained subdued - Germany went from being a capital importer in the 1990s to a capital exporter, and so from posting a current account deficit to a surplus.The low level of overall investment is attributable to numerous factors. Residential investment fell markedly in the aftermath of the real estate bubble of the 1990s. Business investment has been muted on average as well. The overall investment ratio was 16.7 percent in 2013, compared with 22.3 percent in the year 2000.Following the sharp downturn induced by the financial crisis, corporate investment rebounded at first, but then fell a second time, as uncertainty due to the crisis in the euro area started to weigh on growth prospects.Finally, the consolidation of public finances was accompanied by a fall in public investment.Overall, cyclical factors feature prominently when trying to explain the low levels of investment over the last 10 to 15 years. Looking ahead, some of these effects can be expected to abate.Residential investment has gone up markedly in recent years, fuelled by pent-up housing demand and low interest rates. Demographic trends suggest, however, that this development should slow down over the medium term.Corporate investment should follow an upward trajectory as well, as uncertainty surrounding the euro area crisis is slowly subsiding. And almost half of all investment in machinery and equipment is comprised of imports; the moderating effect on the current account is therefore comparatively high.Finally, the German government has also announced an increase, albeit modest, in public investment.But cyclical factors do not tell the whole story. When looking at sectoral developments, one fact is striking. For the last 20 years, total factor productivity (TFP) growth in services has markedly lagged TFP growth in manufacturing. In fact, while TFP in manufacturing has grown by more than 30 percent, TFP growth in services has barely budged.What is behind this phenomenon? The data point to a higher degree of competition in the manufacturing sector following the launch of the common market: mark-ups, an indicator of the pricing power of firms, have gone down since then. By contrast, mark-ups on services have stayed high in Germany, higher even than in many other European countries.Opening up closed professions, cutting red tape, and improving financing conditions for nascent digital firms, would serve to improve the functioning of the services sector.But while there is room for improvement in Germany especially when it comes to the efficiency of its services sector, the fact is that European mark-ups are high in general, compared to the US, for example. It is therefore high time to fully harness the forces of the market for Europe, by making the most of its main catalyst for competition and growth, the European single market.In his report to the European Commission, former Commissioner Mario Monti estimated the potential growth effects of creating a digital single market, which is largely services-based, to be about 4 percent, on a par with the gains made since 1993. Further benefits would ensue from a reduction in the vast number of exemptions in the services directive.  Reforms that strengthen competition in the services sector therefore hold the promise of delivering stronger and more balanced growth. And more balanced growth is likely to translate into a moderation of the current account as well.Still, given its demographics and degree of development, Germany’s role as a capital exporter is unlikely to be completely reversed. This means that, to a certain extent, German surpluses are here to stay - a point that the Commission also emphasised in its recent report.Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.The crisis has shown that a monetary union is not a shield against balance of payments problems in the face of persistent imbalances.Adjustment pressure in a currency area is cushioned by the single monetary policy, which avoids abrupt adjustment but also necessitates additional rules.Regarding the euro-area imbalances, significant progress has been made. But further reforms are needed to facilitate the shift from the non-tradable to the tradable sector and, hence, to strengthen sustainable growth.Stimulating German demand by means of an excessive wage increase or a credit-financed increase in public spending cannot be a substitute for that. And given its demographics and degree of economic development, Germany’s current account is likely to have a positive sign in the future as well.But by removing rigidities in the services sector, Germany might not only strengthen its growth potential, but could do so in a way that is likely to have a moderating impact on the current account as well.Reforms like these show that adjusting imbalances in the euro area does not need to be a zero-sum game. If done properly, it will serve the interests of everyone, and this is why, despite the struggle and setbacks, it is a path worth pursuing.",2014-03-17,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-03-17,"Kiel","Germany","Kieler Konjunkturgespräche des Instituts für Weltwirtschaft","External imbalances in the euro area",3374,20.8,5.2,35.6,13.2,"EN"
"2014-03-26 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for inviting me to speak at the New York Stock Exchange. It is a great honour and pleasure to be here today.In 1792, a few stock brokers gathered under a buttonwood tree at the lower end of Wall Street. In this meeting, they signed an agreement which, in effect, marked the birth of the New York Stock Exchange.Today, more than 200 years later, the buttonwood tree is long gone; it fell during a storm in 1865. However, the New York Stock Exchange is still going strong and has become a guiding light in the financial and economic universe.In this role, it has witnessed its fair share of ups and downs, booms and busts, tranquillity and turmoil. However, the last seven years have mostly been characterised by downs, busts and turmoil. Since 2007, we have lived through a succession of crises: a global financial crisis, a worldwide recession, a sovereign debt crisis in the euro area and, most recently, turbulence in some emerging markets.These episodes have once again underscored how closely interconnected the global economy has become. What drives growth and prosperity in good times can easily turn the other way in a crisis. In a globalised world, a problem at one side of the globe can quickly spread to the other side. To paraphrase Winston Churchill: a financial crisis gets halfway around the world before policymakers have a chance to get their pants on.In a globalised world, what happens in the United States is relevant to Europe and what happens in Europe is relevant to the United States. Against this backdrop, I wish to shed some light on the situation in the euro area and offer you an inside view.For nearly four years now, the state of the euro area has been defined by the sovereign debt crisis. However, I have good news for you - there is light at the end of the tunnel.Most importantly, the euro area as a whole has finally left recession. By now, we have seen three consecutive quarters of positive growth, and looking ahead, the outlook for this year and next year is also quite encouraging. Projections by the ECBsuggest that euro-area GDP will grow by just over 1 percent in 2014 and by 1½ percent in 2015.And this recovery is not only driven by the core euro-area countries such as Germany. Some of the crisis-hit countries have also finally embarked on the path to recovery. And those which have not can at least see the light at the end of the tunnel.It seems that the efforts to implement structural reforms are gradually bearing fruit. Competitiveness has improved in most peripheral countries over the past few years. Almost everywhere, unit labour costs have fallen substantially. Improving competitiveness in turn drives exports higher. All peripheral countries - except Cyprus - are projected to see some export growth this year. These achievements are reflected in current accounts increasingly reverting to positive balances.And Germany is part of this rebalancing equation. Since 2007, Germany’s current account surplus vis-à-vis the euro area has shrunk continuously from 4½ percent of GDP to 2 percent of GDP. As business investment in Germany is projected to pick up in 2014 and 2015, this rebalancing should continue.The progress that these abstract figures reflect is also visible in more concrete events. For example, Ireland and Spain have exited their financial support programmes without any friction. And Portugal is planning to leave its adjustment programme in the first half of this year. All three countries recently returned to the sovereign bond markets at relatively low yields.It seems that international investors are increasingly acknowledging the countries’ efforts and achievements. In the case of Ireland and Portugal, international investors have bought more than 80 percent of the newly issued bonds. At the same time, stock markets in these economies have been rising for some time now. These developments underscore the progress that some peripheral euro-area countries have made in adjusting their economies.However, due to different starting points some countries are naturally more advanced in their adjustment process than others. Especially in Greece further efforts are necessary to manage the turnaround.Now, what is the role of monetary policy in this process? Monetary policy certainly helped to prevent the crisis from escalating. Still, there is one thing we should be clear about: monetary policy cannot solve the underlying causes of the crisis.Nevertheless, some observers propose an even more expansionary monetary policy. They are worried about the risk of deflation in the euro area. It is certainly true that current inflation rates are rather low but, in my view, the risk of deflation is limited. And on this issue, the Bundesbank and the ECB agree.The argument rests on three pillars: First, around two-thirds of the drop in inflation is due to falling prices for energy and food. These are exogenous factors and their effects are likely to be temporary. Second, low inflation rates in the euro area are partly the result of necessary adjustments in the crisis-hit countries. These should also be one-off effects. Third, there are no signs of a self-enforcing downward spiral of prices and wages. Long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored at a level that is in line with the ECB’s definition of price stability. Private households do not seem to be postponing expenditure in expectation of a further drop in prices. There are no indications of a substantial increase in the savings rate.Fears of a fate similar to that of Japan are therefore misplaced. Moreover, the notion of Japan’s lost decades needs to be seen in perspective. The weak growth in Japan is partly a natural consequence of the country’s changing demographics, as the working-age population there has been shrinking since the mid-1990s. That, incidentally, is an economic policy challenge that awaits some euro area economies in the years to come - most notably Germany.So, even after taking into account the issue of deflation, we can still see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, we have not reached it yet. There may still be some obstacles that could block the way - some of them we can already see, others we cannot see.The latter are what Frank Knight, one of the founders of the Chicago school of economics, called unknown unknowns. A recent example is the political crisis in Ukraine. However, while this is an example of an unknown unknown, it has only limited potential to prevent us from reaching the end of the tunnel. Ukraine contributes only a quarter of a percent to global economic output. Furthermore, the exposure of European banks to Ukraine is relatively small. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements it stands at about US$23 billion.A known obstacle that could block our way, on the other hand, is the prolonged period of very low interest rates. But please do not misunderstand me: the current status of monetary policy is certainly adequate. Nevertheless, when interest rates stay very low for a very long time, we may experience unwanted side-effects.One of these side-effects is the search for yield. Investors may eventually increase the risk of their investments to make up for the shortfall in yields caused by low interest rates. And, indeed, it seems that investors already began their search for yield. In corporate debt markets, for instance, valuations are already somewhat stretched. And in the global low-interest rate environment, ambitious valuations may well spread to other market segments.In this regard, the strong recovery in the property markets of some euro-area countries should set us thinking. Take the German housing market, for example. Between 2009 and 2012, prices in large cities rose by almost 25 percent. And, in 2013, they increased by another 8.9 percent. Calculations by the Bundesbank already point to overvaluations in urban areas.Nevertheless, when looking at the German market as a whole, the situation seems less dramatic. In 2013, prices rose by an average of 4.5 percent - a figure that does not give too much cause for concern. Overall, prices in Germany have not yet moved away from fundamentals.For me, warning bells would start ringing if there was a rapid increase in housing prices accompanied by a significant rise in lending. And even more warning bells would be ringing if this rise in credit was accompanied by deteriorating lending standards. Having said that, I can assure you that at this point in time I am surrounded by silence.But it is not only bond markets and housing markets we have to look at. Since we are at the NYSE, let us take a look at stock markets. In 2013, there was only one way for most stock markets to go and that was up. The EuroStoxx 50 increased by 18 percent, the FTSE 100 by 14 percent, the Dow Jones by 28 percent, and the Nikkei skyrocketed by as much as 57 percent. Market volatility decreased, too. After years of risk aversion, sentiment switched to a risk on mode.Did financial markets enter a new phase of irrational exuberance? Such a verdict is certainly debatable. But financial markets are at least anticipating significant further improvements in economic fundamentals and prospects. And they are anticipating that governments around the world will continue to implement the necessary reforms. These expectations create vast scope for confidence shocks.This, in turn, interacts in an unfavourable way with another risk arising from a prolonged period of low interest rates. A prolonged period of low interest rates could set the wrong incentives. It could encourage banks to postpone necessary balance sheet adjustments. And it might induce governments to postpone necessary structural reforms and the consolidation of public finances.In my view, this could be the biggest threat to the recovery process. The improved outlook together with low interest rates could lead to complacency and reform fatigue. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let it happen because there is still a lot to do to put the euro area back on a solid footing. Reform at the national level must continue and, looking to the future, reform at the European level is equally important.At the European level, the most important project is the banking union. The banking union is most certainly the biggest step since the introduction of the euro. And it is the most logical step to take. A single currency requires integrated financial markets and this includes the supervision of banks.Consequently, one of the pillars the banking union rests upon is a Single Supervisory Mechanism - that is European bank supervision for the largest banks. Centralising supervisory powers in such a way can foster a comprehensive and unbiased view upon banks. It also enables policy action that is not held hostage by national interests. Thus, it will contribute to more effective supervision and better cross-border cooperation and coordination.However, the banking union does not rest on one pillar alone. A second pillar is necessary to keep everything in balance. This second pillar is the Single Resolution Mechanism. European bank supervision requires European bank resolution - otherwise there would be an imbalance between liability and control.In a wider sense, resolution mechanisms are essential to solve the too-big-to-fail-problem. Large banks must be able to fail without endangering the stability of the whole system. Otherwise, the government would have to step in to prevent a systemic crisis. This would create an asymmetry: If everything goes well, the bank wins. If everything goes downhill, the taxpayers lose. This creates moral hazard for banks, endangers financial stability and threatens public finances.The Single Resolution Mechanism will solve this problem. It will allow authorities to restructure or resolve banks without putting taxpayers’ money at risk. In the future, whenever a bank fails, resolution costs will have to be borne first by shareholders and creditors. After that, a bank-financed resolution fund will come into play, and only as a last resort are public funds to be used and the taxpayer made to pay.And there is even more to do before the banking union starts. One of the biggest preparatory steps is undoubtedly the Comprehensive Assessment of those banks which will fall under European supervision. This Comprehensive Assessment consists of two elements: a backward-looking Asset Quality Review and a forward-looking stress test.The objective of the Asset Quality Review is to uncover legacy assets in banks’ balance sheets that were accumulated while the banks were under national supervision. The objective of the stress test is to assess how resilient banks are to stress scenarios.Any capital shortfalls revealed by the Comprehensive Assessment have to be rectified before the banking union starts. Ideally, this would primarily involve private funds. If private funds should not be available and the bank has a sustainable business model, the respective government could step in. Ultimately, it is a question of who is responsible for past failings in banking supervision - and that is the individual member states.The Comprehensive Assessment will allow the banking union to start with a clean slate. At the same time, it will support the necessary deleveraging of European banks. Balance sheets will eventually be cleaned up and any doubts regarding their quality will be removed. This will improve banks’ capacity to lend to the real economy and thus support economic growth. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the Comprehensive Assessment is conducted in a tough and thorough manner.In this context, let me briefly compare the European stress test with the corresponding stress tests for the United States. One question might be: which of the two is stricter? Well, comparing the strictness of these two stress tests is not that simple. In the United States, a threshold of 5 per cent of capital relative to a bank’s risk weighted assets is stipulated, in Europe, it is 5.5 per cent. Does this mean the European stress test is stricter? In my mind, such a comparison is inadequate.A meaningful comparison should not only include the threshold for the capital, but also the macro scenario. However, the macro scenarios for the European stress test have yet to be finalised; they are due to be published at the end of April. But even if we knew the scenarios, a comparison would still be difficult: The scenarios do not take into account just one variable, such as GDP growth, but - in the case of the US stress test - 28 variables. What’s more, the horizon of both stress tests is not one year, but more or less three years. A large number of variables therefore have to be compared over a three-year horizon.In all likelihood, any comparison between the two stress tests would therefore be ambiguous. Sound stress testing methods are essential to correctly determine banks’ capital needs, and I am certain that the European stress test will fulfil this requirement.Ladies and gentlemen, I have covered a lot of ground in my speech today. Nonetheless, the central message is straightforward. The situation in the euro area is improving and there is light at the end of the tunnel. However, there is no time for complacency. Risks remain, among them reform fatigue and the side-effects of low interest rates. Thus, we must continue our efforts to put the euro area back on a sound footing.Two weeks ago, ECB president Mario Draghi said that 2012 and 2013 were years of stabilisation for the euro area and that 2014 and 2015 may be years of recovery. If we continue down the path of reform, his expectation will prove correct.But as I said at the beginning, the world has become closely interconnected and so, too, have risks and problems. The prolonged period of low interest rates is as much a global problem as it is a European one.And one thing is certain: interest rates will rise again at some point. However, managing this turnaround will prove a formidable challenge that requires careful policy design and adequate communication. The recent turbulence in emerging markets in response to the Fed’s tapering decision was a case in point.It was a case in point which needs some qualification. In the end, it was domestic problems and a lack of progress in reforms that made some emerging markets vulnerable. To restore investors’ confidence, they should address domestic vulnerabilities by strengthening macroeconomic policies and reinvigorating structural reform efforts.Although the turbulence in emerging markets does not have the potential to derail the global recovery it shows how sensitive markets are at the moment. There is still considerable scope for negative confidence shocks.Therefore, the ball is now in the court of policy-makers - in the euro area, in the United States and in emerging economies. If they press ahead with the necessary reforms, we will eventually be able to leave the times of downs, busts and turmoil behind us.",2014-03-26,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-03-26,"New York","USA","New York Stock Exchange","What is going on in Europe?

"2014-03-28 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for the opportunity to speak today at the Harvard Law School Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century - An Agenda for Europe and the United States. It is a great pleasure to be here.In November 2008, just a few weeks after Lehman Brothers failed, the leaders of the G20 met in Washington D.C. In their meeting they took far-reaching decisions - not only to combat the current crisis but also to prevent future crises. A central passage of their declaration was as follows: We pledge to strengthen our regulatory regimes, prudential oversight, and risk management, and ensure that all financial markets, products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight, as appropriate to their circumstances.Today, more than five years later, we have made good progress. Nevertheless, we must be aware of what Mark Roe from Harvard University calls the regulatory confidence cycle. He writes: Regulators react to an explosion by creating new rules. The economy recovers; the regulators conclude that they did their job well, and the regulated then resist further tightening. […] As the recovery continues and the memory of the financial crisis grows faint, the appetite for regulatory change dissipates. Why fix something that is no longer broken?.On a superficial level it appears that the financial system has been mended. However, we have to ensure that it will not break again - and this is an objective we have not yet achieved. There are still issues we need to address in order to create a stable financial system. In my speech today, I would like to highlight three of these issues: the too-big-to-fail problem which has already been discussed this morning, the shadow banking system, and the market for OTC derivatives. Let us begin with the too-big-to-fail problem.Leaving aside all the nitty gritty, there is one thing we have to do to resolve the too-big-to-fail problem: we need to introduce more market to the financial markets - that is, we have to restore the fundamental principles of a market economy.The most important of these principles is the principle of liability. Everywhere it is common sense that people should be held responsible for their actions. Everywhere but in the world of banking, it would appear. During the crisis, governments around the world spent billions of dollars out of taxpayers' pockets to save the banks. This indicates that the too-big-to-fail banks, at least, play by a different set of rules. They are woven so deeply into the fabric of the financial system that their failure might tear everything apart.The consequence is this: whenever a too-big-to-fail bank runs into trouble, the government might be compelled to bail it out in order to prevent a full-blown financial crisis. This means that these banks are implicitly insured. Whatever happens, the government is likely to stand ready to help.And this has consequences for the nature of the game. First, according to a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, too-big-to-fail banks have a funding advantage over smaller banks. Second, the implicit insurance provides incentives to engage in risky business that promises high returns. If things turn out well, the bank wins. If things go wrong, the taxpayers lose.The principle of liability has obviously been violated. The crucial question at this juncture is the following: what do we need to do to restore it? Well, the decisive point is that banks must be able to fail without dragging the entire financial system down with them. What we need are effective resolution mechanisms for banks. This is common sense at the conceptual level. However, when it comes to implementation, things turn out to be a little more complex.Putting practicable resolution procedures in place is a difficult endeavour, especially in the international context. Systemically important banks have large numbers of entities in many countries, each of which has its own procedures and supervisory traditions. In the absence of a sound legal basis and close cooperation, resolution measures executed in one country might not always be recognised by other countries.Thus a well-coordinated approach between authorities is needed. The purpose is to maintain systemically important activities while resolution procedures are applied. Coordination and advanced planning of resolution measures enable authorities to consider financial stability from an international point of view, not merely from a national perspective. To this end, a new international standard on the recovery and resolution of systemically important institutions has been developed by the Financial Stability Board. Having this new standard is a big step forward.At the European level, a central pillar of the envisaged banking union is the Single Resolution Mechanism. This instrument will allow authorities to restructure or resolve banks without putting taxpayers' money at stake. In the future, whenever a bank fails, resolution costs must be borne first by shareholders and creditors. After that, a bank-financed resolution fund is to come into play, and only as a last resort are public funds to be used and the taxpayers made to pay.We have made good progress at the global and the European level in addressing the too-big-to-fail problem. However, discussions have mainly centred around the banking system. Yet there are other parts of the financial system that might become a source of systemic risk. One of them is the shadow banking system.According to the Financial Stability Board, the shadow banking system comprises credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system. What I think is relevant from a financial stability perspective is that such entities create bank-like risk without being subject to bank regulation.The overall effects of the shadow banking system on financial stability are ambiguous. Theoretically, non-banking financial institutions that perform bank-like activities are associated with diversification and specialisation benefits. Therefore, it could be assumed that they contribute to making the financial system more efficient and more resilient.However, developments in the run-up to the financial crisis revealed something else: activities and entities in the shadow banking system can pose a threat to financial stability. These potential threats are mostly the result of maturity and liquidity transformation, the build-up of leverage and credit risk transfer conducted outside the perimeters of bank regulation.All these activities are not evil per se, but the ensuing systemic risk needs to be contained. All activities must be made transparent, in particular vis-à-vis supervisory authorities, and they need to be adequately regulated. In that regard, I welcome the global regulatory initiative on shadow banking - again under the leadership of the Financial Stability Board.And here too, international cooperation is essential for establishing effective regulation. A central feature of the shadow banking system is regulatory arbitrage: activities are shifted from the banking system to the shadow banking system in order to evade regulation. A geographically fragmented approach to regulation would not curb regulatory arbitrage but just take it to another level. Against this backdrop, it is to be welcomed that the G20 have placed the shadow banking system high up on their agenda.The third issue I would like to raise relates to the structure of the market - the derivatives market, to be precise. Trading in derivatives certainly has the potential to cause massive losses, to disrupt markets and to threaten financial stability.But it is not just during trading that financial stability can be put at risk; it can also be jeopardised at the back office level when transactions are cleared and settled. And this might pose a problem for all market participants, be they part of the banking system or the shadow banking system.The G20's decision to require OTC derivatives to be cleared centrally was an important cornerstone in regulating OTCderivatives markets.Central counterparties, or CCPs in short, are able to mitigate systemic risk and act as risk buffers in global financial markets. This appears particularly striking when we consider two sources of potentially huge losses: first, extremely one-sided derivatives positions and, second, the high degree of opacity surrounding the interconnectedness of global financial players. In this regard, CCPs will help to better solve another problem I already mentioned: the too-big-to-fail issue.However, CCPs themselves are becoming more systemically important. This harbours potential side effects which need to be monitored. Furthermore, effective recovery and resolution regimes need to be in place for CCPs. To shield taxpayers' money, potential losses have to be distributed among clearing participants, which are often globally active banks. This gives rise to potential contagion risks and domino effects. Therefore, a careful calibration of recovery and resolution regimes is crucial.Against this backdrop, international coordination is again essential. The regulation of OTC derivatives markets should be the same across all jurisdictions - in spirit, in wording, and in terms of its outcome. This would allow the corresponding national regulators to defer to each other's rules when cross-border transactions occur. Otherwise, regulatory arbitrage, market fragmentation and liquidity disruptions might be the consequences.Some progress has been made over the past year towards resolving these cross-border issues. One example is the 'Path Forward', a joint statement which was agreed upon by the European Commission and the CFTC in July 2013. This statement is a necessary foundation for further cooperation. However, some cross-border matters are still unresolved and urgently need to be addressed.Major differences between the US and EU regulations can be found, for instance, in the methods used to compute the initial margin coverage of CCPs. And they can also be found in the scope of reporting requirements to trade repositories. Let us take a brief look at these two examples.First, the rules used for calculating the minimum initial margins of CCPs differ between the US and the EU. Generally speaking, CCPs ask for initial margins in order to hedge the market risk of a derivatives position during the liquidation period in case a clearing member defaults. Under the existing EU and USregulation, risk managers at CCPs have to take into account different minimum liquidation periods and confidence intervals when calculating adequate initial margins. As a result, the initial margins requested by CCPs may vary considerably, depending on the location of a CCP. This might eventually drive business towards those CCPs with less strict initial margin calculation requirements. To prevent such regulatory arbitrage from happening, it might make sense to agree on consistent and strict international standards in detail and thus reduce national leeway.Second, the mandatory reporting rules differ significantly in terms of timing and scope. In the US, only CFTC-registered Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants are required to report their transactions to trade repositories in real time. In the EU, meanwhile, transactions have to be reported by the end of the next business day by both contracting parties. Furthermore, exchange traded derivatives, market prices and collateral levels have to be reported in the EU, but not in the US. It remains to be seen whether these differing reporting rules can be recognised as being equivalent. And - more importantly - it also remains to be seen how a meaningful and accurate global aggregation of trade repository data can be brought about.Ladies and gentlemen, I have briefly discussed the too-big-to-fail problem, the shadow banking system and the market for OTCderivatives. Each of these issues highlights the need for international cooperation. If we do not coordinate our approaches towards regulation we will create a fragmented financial system. A financial system with vast opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and ample sources of systemic risk.Against this backdrop, recent regulatory initiatives in the US worry me. They seem to contradict the need for international cooperation. A Balkanisation of the regulatory space represents a genuine risk, and any regulatory decision should be taken with that consideration in mind - in Europe as well as in the United States.And this not only applies to regulation itself but also to the foundation on which it rests. Regulating and supervising financial institutions requires information. And to satisfy the need for international cooperation, this information has to be internationally comparable. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.It is not an entirely new insight that differences in accounting standards across countries hamper the international comparability of balance sheet data. This in turn can potentially impede financial regulation. A prominent example is the treatment of derivatives and how this affects balance sheet ratios which are subject to regulation.Derivatives netting rules under US GAAP allow US financial institutions to net their derivatives positions to a large extent. In Europe, the IFRS accounting rules are far more restrictive in this regard. That is why derivatives volumes appear to be much larger at European banks than at their US counterparts.Going one step further, regulatory balance sheet ratios which relate to total assets differ between US and European banks. The leverage ratios of US banks, for instance, generally appear much lower than those of European banks. Hence, in this particular case, distortions arising from different accounting rules may make it easier for banks in the US to comply with a given regulatory leverage ratio than for their European peers.So far, standard setters have only agreed to harmonise the information disclosed in the notes of financial statements. Nevertheless, global harmonisation of accounting standards is needed in order to create a regulatory level playing field and avoid regulatory arbitrage. In my view, this is certainly something that has to be moved higher up the agenda of global regulation.Ladies and gentlemen, we have made good progress in adjusting financial regulation. Nevertheless, we have not reached our destination; regulatory reform has to continue. I have discussed some of the outstanding issues in my speech: too-big-to-fail banks, shadow banking, OTC derivatives and accounting standards. I also highlighted the need for international cooperation.At the beginning of my speech I cited a passage from the G20's Washington declaration. Let me close my speech by quoting another passage: Our financial markets are global in scope, therefore, intensified international cooperation among regulators and strengthening of international standards, where necessary, and their consistent implementation is necessary to protect against adverse cross-border, regional and global developments affecting international financial stability.That is the spirit, ladies and gentlemen.

"2014-03-28 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","Thank you for awarding me the Wolfram Engels Prize, and my special thanks to you, Professor Siegert, for the laudation.The Wolfram Engels Prize was last awarded in 2007. It is therefore by no means awarded in an inflationary manner - not at all a mistake in the eyes of a central banker. This makes this award, bestowed in honour of a dedicated champion of the market economy, even more special.I am delighted to accept this prize and see it as supporting not only my work but, above all, that of the Deutsche Bundesbank and its staff, fully aware that the Bank’s opinion is not shared in all quarters. The Bank has recently been referred to as the centre of the most dogmatic neo-liberal thinking in Europe. I assume this was not meant as a compliment, and, moreover, it is not even accurate.The Market Economy Foundation, the foundation awarding this prize, campaigns for regulatory policy and market-oriented thought and is thus making a vital contribution to the economic policy debate. And it is precisely this approach that sits more comfortably with the Bank’s own stance.Together with the Kronberger Kreis, the foundation strives to have market economy principles valued and respected, and to widen the reach of social market economy ideas.I would like to take this opportunity to speak about market economy principles in the European monetary union and to discuss how to strengthen the principle of liability, as a constitutive principle of monetary union.Constitutive principles is of course an allusion to Walter Eucken, whose constitutive principles of competitive order are still the main pillars of our current economic constitution.Effective competition is key for a market economy and its economic performance. In turn, competition requires free price formation. Competition creates prosperity. However, competition also requires protection.For competition to have a control function, prices must be stable. Eucken thus stressed the primacy of monetary policy. He also noted the importance of central rights and obligations for a competitive economy: open markets, rights to private property, freedom of contract and the principle of liability, which I have already mentioned.He defines liability as an essential regulatory policy institution. In his Principles of economic policy, he uses the example of an economic order with private property and a centrally controlled economy to demonstrate what happens when liability and control (steering power) drift apart.Given the institutional framework of monetary union, this problem is still highly topical, and I shall revisit it later on.Eucken names consistency of economic policy as the final constitutive principle of competitive order. He complains that economic policymakers suffer from a nervous restlessness, often today dispensing with those very rules that were in place yesterday. Little has changed over time. Eucken’s words still ring true regarding current economic policy measures in Berlin.The introduction of a statutory minimum wage of €8.50 to be applied across the board launches a large-scale macroeconomic experiment which, if applied as intended, may endanger the labour market success of recent years. And the pension package will go back on some previous pension reforms and create incentives for early retirement, thwarting the necessary extension of working life given an ageing population.Such a policy will place an additional burden on future generations but, as Groucho Marx once said, Why should I do anything for posterity? What has posterity ever done for me?While the ordoliberals of the Freiburg School stressed the importance of Ordnungspolitik (translatable as regulatory policy) and mostly rejected intervention in economic processes (such as introducing a minimum wage), the founding fathers of the social market economy saw a need for government economic policy over and beyond this framework.However, economic policy should be in line with the market mechanism and comply with the principle of subsidiarity. The principle of economic policy in line with the market mechanism and the principle of subsidiarity, borrowed from Catholic social teachings, are thus likewise to be seen as the founding principles of our economic order.Thus, market economy principles have not just shaped the economic system in Germany, but are also major pillars of European integration.A constitutive principle of European economic integration was, and still is, non-discrimination against external providers of goods and services. The four fundamental freedoms of the single market are the result of this principle and are summed up succinctly in an expert opinion by the Kronberger Kreis on European integration, to which Wolfram Engels also contributed: The libertarian message of the Treaty of Rome was an economy with cross-border competition.The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the activities of the European Union are to be conducted in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition. European competition law and rules on state aid have had beneficial effects on member states, often despite resistance from national policymakers - one example being market liberalisation. The Market Economy Foundation rightly awarded the Wolfram Engels Prize to Mario Monti, then a European Commissioner, in 2001 for his commitment to competition law in Europe.Open markets and free, but protected, competition have increased levels of prosperity in Europe and this economic success played a major role in making European integration attractive, especially to central and eastern European countries. However, accession to the EU has also meant new dependencies and contagion channels requiring member states to toughen their stance on stability.However, European policy is of course not to be considered sacred. Policies made in Brussels are not always in line with noble principles, such as that of market conformity or subsidiarity. We only need think of the Common Agricultural Policy or the Common Industrial Policy. Policymakers in Brussels and national policymakers act no differently; both are quick to put market economy principles second if this appears warranted in the pursuit of supposedly more important objectives.Those in favour of a minimum wage, rent price ceiling or the policy switch to non-nuclear energy generation are undoubtedly pursuing honourable and important objectives. However, experience has shown that social and ecological objectives, too, can generally be achieved more successfully if political instruments are in line with, and not opposed to, the principles of market economy.The Kronberger Kreis’ first study back in 1983 was entitled Mehr Mut zum Markt (More market, more glory). This is still the motto of the Kronberger Kreis today and is just as pertinent. However, this reaffirmation of the market is otherwise currently not so popular.The crisis has certainly changed the view of the market economy system and has raised doubts about the efficiency of markets. Business as usual is, of course, not an option.However, I do not believe that the crisis has called into question the fundamental principles of market economy. Instead, the crisis has shown that the principles embodied by Ordnungspolitik were not sufficiently implemented in some areas. For instance, in the financial sector, these principles and the resultant rules had virtually been reversed in some cases.The European Union is also based on market economy principles; two in particular: first, the principle of liability and, second, that which Eucken called primacy of monetary policy.Primacy of monetary policy is reflected by the fact that the Eurosystem has chosen price stability as its primary objective. The Eurosystem shall support the general economic policies in the Union but only where this is [without] prejudice to the objective of price stability (Article 127 TFEU).According to the legal opinion of the Federal Constitutional Court, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy mandate stops where the Eurosystem begins managing economic policy; in other words, if the Eurosystem, for instance, grants financial aid to member states or takes measures to safeguard the current composition of the euro area.Prices must be stable for competition to have a control function. In his book Wohlstand für alle (Prosperity for all), Ludwig Erhard wrote the social market economy is unthinkable without a consistent policy of price stability.In line with his convictions, Erhard campaigned for the Bundesbank’s primary task to be safeguarding price stability and for it to remain independent from political interference. The Bundesbank thus became a model of success. However, it was decades before the model of an independent central bank whose primary mandate is pursuing the objective of price stability took hold internationally.Independence is not an end in itself - the central bank should not become a state within a state. Instead it should be aware of the fact that independence and price stability are positively correlated. Independent central banks are better able to safeguard price stability than dependent ones. Independence and a Eurosystem mandate strictly limited to price stability are thus two sides of the same coin.Conversely, this means that the trend currently emerging to confer more and more responsibility on central banks can ultimately challenge their independence. This, in turn, can make it more difficult for central banks to maintain price stability.Some may contend that the crisis has shown that monetary policy should not just focus on keeping consumer prices stable, but should also safeguard the stability of the financial system. However, I believe that it would be a mistake to define financial stability as an additional objective for monetary policy under a dual mandate.However, this naturally does not mean that central banks should not assume any responsibility for financial stability. The reigning consensus is that central banks should be given a macroprudential mandate.At European level we now have the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and, in Germany, the Financial Stability Committee (FSC). Central banks play a major role in both of these institutions. The FSC, which was set up in 2013, comprises the Bundesbank, the Federal Ministry of Finance, BaFin and - in an advisory function - the Federal Agency for Financial Market Stabilisation.The committee discusses risks to the stability of the financial system based on analyses conducted by the Bundesbank. If the committee fears that unfavourable developments are afoot, it can issue warnings or recommendations. However, it does not have the authority to decide on macroprudential measures.As macroprudential measures can trigger massive redistribution effects, the decision as to whether they are implemented requires parliamentary control and should therefore not be made by an independent central bank. Such a decision could ultimately endanger a central bank’s independence.There is also no doubt that financial stability policy requires its own set of tools. However, the macroprudential toolkit for financial stability policymakers, including those such as countercyclical capital buffers for banks, is still a work in progress and has yet to be put to the test.It is essential, and the ECB Governing Council is united on this front, that involving central banks in financial stability policy does not alter the primary objective of monetary policy - ensuring price stability. Otherwise the credibility of monetary policy could be endangered. And money is nothing other than trust that has taken on solid form.However, as monetary policymakers, we should not stand on the sidelines and watch the next crisis brewing. Any looming financial imbalances that pose a threat to price stability should be countered with monetary policy tools.Incidentally, this has already been built into the ECB Governing Council’s two-pillar strategy. The aim of monetary analysis, which is part of the second of these pillars, is to identify the medium to long-term inflation risks resulting from monetary variables.However, monetary analysis is no crystal ball giving a glimpse into the future. The financial market crisis has also impeded the predictive quality of financial or monetary indicators for future price developments. In this regard, it is also a work in progress.The second fundamental principle of monetary union is the principle of individual national responsibility.Much as a market economy can function only if businesspersons assume responsibility for the consequences of their decisions, a monetary union, too, can only function if governments and banks carry the responsibility for their decisions.In the Maastricht Treaty, monetary union is defined in such a way that monetary and foreign exchange policy are communitised but fiscal and economic policy remain a national responsibility. As a result of this asymmetrical set-up - one monetary policy, 18 fiscal policies - the stability of the single currency is under constant tension.The already existing propensity to run up debt is even higher for governments in monetary union as the negative repercussion of excessive debt can be passed on in part to other member states. In addition, it was clear when the monetary union was set up that the member states would borrow with money they could not create on their own; doubts about the solvency of a country could therefore more quickly have serious consequences for the financial stability of the country in question and thus spread to the other member states.This is one of the reasons why fiscal discipline is so important in a monetary union, which is why precautions to prevent risks to stability were inserted into the Treaty.First, the member states agreed, in particular, to avoid excessive deficits; the debt rules were fleshed out in the Stability and Growth Pact.Second, monetary financing of governments was prohibited by banning central banks from lending to member states.Third, the member states agreed that each country is and remains responsible for its own debt. In addition, the no-bailout rule states that no EU institution and no member state is responsible for the debt of another.In the 1992 study on unity and plurality in Europe already cited above, the Kronberger Kreis around Wolfram Engels critically examined the issue of fiscal discipline, stating that There are, however, also factors that give rise to the fear that convergence with fiscal discipline may not be strong enough to prevent undesirable developments.The hope prior to monetary union had been that the financial markets would exert a disciplinary effect on fiscal policy. It was expected that the exclusion of mutual liability would cause investors in government securities to demand adequate risk premiums, which would have rendered government borrowing that much more expensive.This expectation was not fulfilled, however. On the contrary, exceptional interest rate convergence even before monetary union enabled the previously high interest rate countries to borrow on exceptionally favourable terms.The fact that risk premiums for all countries of the monetary union contracted so heavily, receding in some cases to only a few basis points, is likely, among other things, to be attributable to investors’ apparent doubts about the credibility of the exclusion of liability. In any event, most recent history has shown that the doubts about the no bail-out rule were not irrational.The fact is that the low interest rates caused a great deal of capital to flow into the euro-area periphery countries, which was not put to use in a very profitable manner. Wage increases which outpace productivity growth put additional strains on the competitiveness of economies. On balance, public and/or private debt grew strongly while current accounts deteriorated.This was the breeding ground for the euro-area debt crisis, which began in 2010 following the global financial and economic crisis. The substantial increase in risk premiums for bonds of peripheral countries pushed several countries, in particular Greece, to the brink of insolvency.In this crisis situation, the euro rescue packages and Eurosystem measures prevented the crisis from escalating. However, these crisis measures permanently weakened the principle of individual responsibility.They caused a redistribution of risk and put elements of mutualised liability in place, disrupting the balance in the relationship between liability and control in the regulatory framework of monetary union: the set of options for controlling the member states’ borrowing did not keep pace.One might argue that the fiscal rules were, in fact, tightened in the aftermath of the crisis - Stability and Growth Pact, fiscal compact and European semester are concepts which come to mind. Undoubtedly, these were steps in the right direction. But whether these tightened rules will have the desired binding effect remains to be seen. It is, above all, the European Commission that is called upon to be strict in laying down the rules, and certain doubts are unfortunately justified.As we know, it is not the case that there haven’t been any rules in place thus far. However, they have been inadequately implemented. The deficit limit of 3 percent of GDP has been breached seven times by Germany, eight times by France and a whole of nine times by Italy. According to the Commission’s forecast, eight of the 18 member states will breach the deficit ceiling this year.Allow me to quote one last time from the 1992 Kronberger Kreis study - with a wink: From the point of view of an individual country, the agreed ceilings for deficits and debt levels represent a certain protection against unsound fiscal policies of other members of the union. At the same time, however, it is also a self-commitment by the governments of the member states towards their citizens. The fact that the European Commission has been tasked with monitoring compliance with the criteria reinforces this self-commitment and does not imply the Commission’s conservatorship over national fiscal policy just yet.22 years later, we must admit that we were probably a bit too optimistic regarding the self-commitment and its reinforcement by the Commission.The key question now is how to once again reconcile liability and control or, in other words, how the framework of monetary union can be reformed to provide the common currency with a solid foundation.Essentially, as the Scientific Advisory Board at the Federal Ministry of Finance put it as well, there is the choice between two diametrically opposing institutional arrangements. Either we proceed towards deeper political integration - a fiscal union, say - or we improve on the existing framework and bolster the individual national responsibility of the individual member states as a constitutive feature of monetary union.However, a fiscal union must not simply mean extending mutualised liability, because that would merely be a transfer union. A real fiscal union would depend on the member states transferring national sovereignty to the community level, for example by giving the community the necessary right to intervene in the event of unsound public finances.I believe that there is currently no will, among either the general public or governments, to truly concede sovereignty, which would be a prerequisite for a fiscal union; and this state of affairs is not about to change anytime soon. On the contrary, the member states continue to insist on having the final say.When the European Commission recommended last year that the deadline for correcting the excessive government deficit be extended for France and other countries, while in return expecting France to implement concrete reforms, the French president reacted indignantly saying that: The European Commission cannot dictate to us what we have to do.I think this example illustrates rather clearly the willingness of the member states to allow interference from outside parties.Therefore, it seems to be that strengthening the Maastricht framework is the only way forward when it comes to establishing a stable regulatory framework. However, this would mean that the liability principle, too, would have to be strengthened or, to quote Otmar Issing: For a monetary union, in which the countries (…) have transferred their monetary policy to a supranational institution, while insisting in all other areas that they remain sovereign states, the no-bail-out principle is the only solution. Those who insist on self-determination must bear the consequences of their own actions by themselves.But how can the liability principle be strengthened and what does strengthening the Maastricht framework mean in concrete terms?Strengthening the liability principle essentially means that both governments and banks must continue to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. This implies that citizens are primarily liable for the public finances of the country in question, and that, secondarily, investors bear the consequences of their investment decisions.I believe, for example, that a European framework which is based on individual national responsibility must first fall back on the taxpayers of the affected country in an exceptional financial emergency of a member state, given that high public debt levels are often associated with significant private net wealth.In order for governments with a waning creditworthiness to gain time to find sustainable solutions for their public finances, it is also important to be able to restructure government debt without endangering the stability of the financial system. Introducing collective action clauses for the issuance of sovereign bonds was certainly a step in the right direction. However, the Bundesbank believes that additional steps are required.The Bundesbank suggested that a clause should be hard-wired into the terms and conditions for the issuance of euro-area government bonds that would automatically extend the maturity of a given country’s bonds by three years if that country received loans from the ESM fund. Automatically extending bond maturities in this manner would buy time for crisis countries to resolve their problems without private creditors pulling their capital out. This would allow a better balance to be struck between liability and control.First, the automatic extension of maturities would cause the volume of financial assistance to decrease significantly. Second, sufficient time would be available to determine whether the problem is one of solvency or liquidity, in other words whether a country is permanently or only temporarily unable to obtain funding in the market.Strengthening the liability principle ultimately means that, in extremis, it must be possible to declare governments and systemically important banks insolvent without jeopardising financial stability in the single currency area. Only the possibility of failure can ensure that financial markets exercise their disciplining function on banks and governments.Until now, the insolvency of governments and systemically important banks has practically not been permitted because of the probably quite realistic fear that this would threaten the stability of the financial system in the whole euro area. So what ought to be done to ensure that insolvent governments and banks no longer represent a systemic risk in future?Among other things, the disastrous sovereign-bank nexus would have to be broken. To ensure this, we must do the following.First, we must further strengthen the financial system’s resilience.Second, we must regulate the financial markets strictly and on the basis of uniform rules.Third, we must effectively implement a credible resolution regime for banks.And lastly, we must end preferential regulatory treatment of government bonds.Progress has already been made with regard to resilience; in particular the implementation of the Basel III capital rules improves banks’ ability to absorb loss. Moreover, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which is due to be launched in November of this year, offers the opportunity to apply a uniform and rigorous supervisory regime.European banking supervision also requires European banking resolution; otherwise, there would be a disconnect between control and liability. It is therefore right that a Single Resolution Mechanism is now about to be established.Wolfram Engels once wrote: Bankruptcy is a part of the market economy. However, it has been virtually impossible to apply this essentially self-evident principle to the banking sector.In the future, whenever a bank fails, resolution costs must generally be borne first by shareholders and creditors at the top of a liability cascade. After that, a bank-financed resolution fund would come into play, and only as a last resort should public - read, taxpayer - funds be used.This is what the Council, Parliament and Commission agreed this past week, which is to be welcomed. Despite individual exceptions with regard to details, which are part and parcel of the process of compromise, the agreed resolution mechanism allows a fundamental principle of market economics to be enforced; it should primarily be the owners and creditors of a bank who bear the risks of their investments and not the taxpayer.To sever the harmful sovereign-bank nexus, the preferential regulatory treatment of government bonds, too, would have to cease. This is an anachronism based on the false assumption that government bonds are risk-free investments. The crisis has vividly demonstrated that investments in government bonds, too, entail risks.At present, no large exposure limits are in place for government bonds - nor are banks required to back government bonds with capital. Under the current capital rules, a zero risk weight applies to these assets, which means that these government bonds can be fully funded with borrowed money, which gives them an advantage over lending to the private sector.This preferential treatment has been a factor in banks in several euro-area periphery states, in particular, raising their exposure to domestic government bonds during the crisis; they have thereby tied even more closely their fate to that of their national government. Banks tend to circumvent the liability principle in this way.If all goes well, banks pocket a decent profit owing to the crisis countries’ comparatively high bond yields and the favourable refinancing rates. However, if the government were to become insolvent, the consequences for banks would be negligible as they would ultimately have to be resolved in any case.For this reason, I have for quite some time now been calling for government bonds to be backed with a level of capital that adequately reflects the risk and for caps to be imposed on such investments, as is commonplace for loans to private debtors. And I am glad that Federal Finance Minister Schäuble has come to share this view. At a Bundesbank conference some weeks ago he said: This issue must be put on the political agenda.Meanwhile, he will need to persuade his colleagues in the more highly indebted countries; after all, zero-weighting is a major selling point for government bonds, including those with a lower credit rating.In conclusion, it can probably be said that a great deal has been set in motion to make the financial system more robust, but a lot remains to be done. What is clear, and I would hereby like to wrap up my comments on the reform of the operational framework of monetary union, is that a stable monetary union cannot exist without a stable financial system.Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of my speech I would like to once again express my gratitude for being awarded the Wolfram Engels Prize. I would also like to thank the informedia foundation for donating the prize money of €15,000.With good reason, the Bundesbank’s code of conduct prohibits Board members from accepting such sums of money for themselves. Instead, I would like to see this money go to Deutscher Kinderhospizverein. The association helps children who suffer from a life-shortening disease and their families along this difficult path - a commitment I believe deserves the highest recognition and support.Being awarded the Wolfram Engels Prize encourages me to continue to take clear and sometimes uncomfortable stands. I firmly believe that market economy principles and the rule of law are the main pillars of our economic order, European integration and monetary union.Those who emphasise principles quickly gain a reputation for being a stickler for principles. However, a key lesson from the crisis is that the positive influence of markets can only be effective if the implementation of market economy principles of order is ensured.Before I take up any more of your time, another Erhardt quote comes to mind - not by Ludwig Erhard this time but by Heinz Erhardt who said that one generally produces many words if one has nothing to say.On that note, I hope I haven’t produced too many words this evening and would like to thank you for your attention.",2014-03-28,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-03-28,"Kronberg","Germany","Verleihung des Wolfram-Engels-Preises","Market economy principles in monetary union",4577,22.6,5.2,31.3,14.2,"EN"
"2014-04-07 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","I thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity to speak here today.The Duitsland Instituut's mission is to increase knowledge of Germany and disseminate this knowledge to a wide audience in the Netherlands. I am glad to join in this effort today, though I will confine myself to the Bundesbank's take on matters of the Economic and Monetary Union. Adding more issues to that would probably constitute an overburdening of the monetary policymaker you see before you. And overburdening monetary policy is of course anathema to the Bundesbank.To me, it seems particularly befitting to talk about the challenges of the intricate construction that is our monetary union here in Amsterdam.As you know better than I do, up until the 12th century, the area of what is today known as the Province of Holland was basically considered uninhabitable. The area consisted mostly of swampland and morass, and was traversed by many rivers. It took the erection of a dam to protect a small patch of land from the Amstel River and the tireless effort of pushing countless wooden piles up to 18 meters deep into the ground to lay a foundation that proved solid enough. Solid enough to pave some roads and to build the first houses of what would later become the city of Amsterdam. Nobody would claim now that it was not worth the effort. Amsterdam is both unique and beautiful.And this is where the European monetary union comes in. There are surely more obvious places to build a currency union than in Europe. Without a doubt the euro area lacks some of the characteristics of an optimal currency area. Labour mobility, for instance, is much lower than in the US; plus the business cycles are not synchronised, nor is there any central fiscal stabiliser. At the end of the day, the decision to create the European monetary union was a political one, not an economic one.But I am positive that if we learn from the sovereign debt crisis and do not falter in our efforts to push enough piles into the right parts of that tricky ground, the European monetary union can be preserved as a place of stability that is worth living in. In the first 15 years since the euro was launched, people have enjoyed a stable currency. The average euro-area inflation rate was 2.0 percent, which is very close to the ECB Governing Council's definition of price stability (below, but close to, 2 percent).In the next 30 minutes, I will present my views on which additional piles are required and how they will need to be arranged in order to preserve the European monetary union as a stability union. In doing so, I will first look into what still needs to be done at the country level. From there, I will go on to address the weaknesses in EMU's institutional foundation.But before talking about what needs to be done, let us take a step back and consider what went wrong in the first place.For many euro-area member states, the introduction of the euro ushered in a new era of abundant capital, due to the elimination of exchange rate risks. And standard economic reasoning suggests that capital should flow from capital-rich to capital-poor economies, where returns should be higher.However, the favourable financing conditions in the euro-area countries with previously higher interest rates mainly stimulated their domestic consumption, thereby raising prices and wages in the non-tradable sector. To put it in a nutshell: inflowing capital was not always put to productive use.Overinvestment in real estate as well as public and private consumption failed to raise productivity in some member countries. Unit labour costs soared, competitiveness declined. And the rigidity of labour and product markets meant that this process gained even more momentum.When the financial crisis broke out in 2007, the vulnerabilities became apparent: investor sentiment began to shift, and interest rates for the countries in question started to rise sharply, triggering a crisis that is still far from being fully resolved.How could it go so wrong? Here is where the euro area's unique institutional set-up comes in.The euro area teams up one common monetary policy with 18 national fiscal and economic policies. This approach reflects a currency area composed of sovereign member states. It grants member states enough room for manoeuvre to preserve their diversity, that is, to establish their own business models or to tailor institutions and policies to their own national preferences. Such preferences can differ, for example, with respect to income redistribution or the role of the state in the economy. At the same time, it leaves the consequences of such decisions with the respective member state and consistently rules out the option of mutualising public debt with other euro-area states.But this set-up also creates vulnerabilities.First, such a combination gives rise to a deficit bias, as it allows the costs of fiscal imprudence to be shifted partially on to others. An unsustainable fiscal situation in one country has repercussions for monetary union as a whole.And second, each member state issues debt in a currency it cannot create. Thus, a high level of fiscal discipline is needed to ensure that solvency concerns do not spiral out of control. This notwithstanding, the central banks' balance sheets can serve as a conduit for shifting risks among national taxpayers, even if there are no explicit fiscal transfers and irrespective of the approval of national legislatures - thus undermining countries' individual national responsibility and hence the very foundations upon which responsible decision-making is built.However, if central bank independence is used for purposes other than price stability, it is only a question of time until central bank independence is challenged.The founding fathers of the euro clearly foresaw the risk of unsustainable public finances for a stability-oriented monetary policy. Therefore, precautions were put in place to safeguard sound public finances. They took the form of a prohibition of monetary financing of government deficits, the no bail out clause and the Stability and Growth Pact.Barry Eichengreen and Charles Wyplosz wrote in an article in 1998: The most compelling rationale for the Stability Pact rests on the need to buttress the no-bailout rule of the Maastricht Treaty. And having a good sense of what might happen, the two economists continued: That need will be most pressing where debt problems place banking systems at risk and where bond market contagion is pervasive.At the time, it was assumed that by constraining governments' ability to fiscally stimulate demand - and by shifting monetary policy to the European level - governments would have no choice but to implement structural reforms, improve their supply side, and strengthen their potential for sustainable growth.It was also thought that the financial markets would enforce fiscal discipline. As we know now, things did not exactly work out as expected. So, in a sense, the piles on which monetary union was built turned out to be unsound. The fiscal rules were breached numerous times, not least by Germany and France.In addition, investors made hardly any distinction between the bonds of individual member states. From 1999 to 2007 the average difference between EMU government bonds, excluding Germany, and German government bonds, for instance, was a mere 14 basis points. Just for comparison: at the end of March that spread stood at 123 basis points.I leave it to you to decide whether this was because investors were neglecting the growing differences in economic fundamentals or because they never really believed that the no bail out clause would hold when the going got tough. In any case, the strong convergence in financing conditions set the wrong incentives: governments' purses were loosened, not tightened, structural reforms were postponed, not pushed.By the same token, banks and capital markets in many cases failed to allocate the inflowing capital efficiently. Instead of financing productive investment they shifted money into ballooning real estate sectors. As a result, banking systems in some euro-area countries were subsequently hit hard by a severe crisis.In sum, this is what, to me, largely explains the unsustainable developments in the run-up to the crisis. Hence, work is needed on three levels.First of all, the countries have to correct the macroeconomic imbalances and to boost the potential for sustainable growth by regaining competitiveness, by consolidating public finances, and by catching up on long-delayed structural reforms.Second, we need to address the weaknesses in the monetary union's institutional architecture.And third, we need a more resilient financial system. Owing to regulatory weaknesses, the financial system acted as an amplifying transmitter of the crisis.Due to time constraints, I would like to focus primarily on the first two issues. Let's have a look at the state of play in the member states.In many countries, structural reforms to remove rigidities in product and labour markets are now underway. A number of labour market reforms have been introduced to foster employment and reduce adjustment costs during economic downswings. In addition, the retirement age has been raised as well. Product market rigidities that weaken competition, produce regulatory red tape, and inhibit growth, are also being addressed.And according to the World Bank's Doing Business Report, progress has been made in this regard as well: Portugal, Italy, and Spain have climbed up the ranking ladder by 17, 13, and 10 positions respectively over the last four years. Greece moved up by 37 positions. Unit labour costs and current accounts of deficit countries have improved - not only because of shrinking imports, but also because of expanding exports.Factors of production are being reallocated to sectors with a strong focus on exports. The construction sector in Ireland accounted for over half of the decrease in aggregate employment; in Spain, Italy and Portugal, it accounted for around two-fifths. In industry, by contrast, either far fewer jobs have been cut or - as in Ireland - new jobs have recently been created.Real value added, in particular, far exceeded its pre-crisis level in the export-intensive information and communications sector in Spain and Ireland as early as in 2012. In Ireland, other business-related services also showed substantial growth. Compared to its pre-crisis level, real value added in trade and tourism increased in Portugal and remained virtually unchanged in Spain.Progress has been uneven, though, and further reforms are needed to facilitate this shift from the non-tradable to the tradable sector and, therefore, to strengthen sustainable growth.Overcoming the crisis is still an uphill struggle; if you don't go forwards, you go backwards. With regard to reforms, governments therefore have to keep the pedal to the metal. In footballing terms, I would say the half-time whistle has blown. However, there is no time for a break.Without doubt, adjustment has to happen primarily in the deficit countries, but countries with a current account surplus, such as the Netherlands and Germany, face challenges as well. While the Netherlands is still dealing with the aftermath of a housing bust, demographic trends require Germany to raise its potential for sustainable growth.Germany's overall investment ratio was 16.7 percent in 2013, compared with 22.3 percent in the year 2000. This low level of investment is attributable to numerous factors, many of them cyclical in nature. However, improving the conditions for investment in energy, transport and communications networks - like fast and efficient implementation procedures - would raise Germany's long-term growth potential, as would further investment in research and education.In order to counter the demographic challenges, Germany should improve pre-school education and support educationally disadvantaged young people in order to foster their employability.Furthermore, we should reduce, rather than create, incentives for early retirement, and we need a systematic approach to attract skilled labour from abroad, whose expertise is needed. And I am not talking about all the world-class footballers from the Netherlands and many other countries who play in Germany's Bundesliga.When looking at sectoral developments in Germany, one fact is striking. For the last 20 years, productivity growth in services has lagged markedly behind growth in manufacturing. In fact, while productivity in manufacturing has grown by more than 30 percent, productivity growth in services has barely budged. Why is that?The data point to a higher degree of competition in the manufacturing sector: Mark-ups, an indicator of the pricing power of firms, have gone down following the launch of the common market. By contrast, mark-ups on services have stayed high in Germany, higher even than in many other European countries. Opening up closed professions, cutting red tape and improving access to financing for nascent digital firms would serve to improve the functioning of the services sector.But while there is room for improvement in Germany especially when it comes to the efficiency of its services sector, the fact is that European mark-ups are elevated in general, compared to the US, for example. It is therefore high time to fully harness the forces of the market for Europe, by making the most of its main catalyst for competition and growth, the European single market.In his report to the European Commission, former Commissioner Mario Monti estimated the potential growth effects of creating a digital single market, which is largely services-based, to be about 4 percent, on a par with the gains made since 1993.Further benefits would ensue from a reduction in the vast number of exemptions in the Services Directive. Reforms that strengthen competition in the services sector therefore hold the promise of delivering stronger and more balanced growth. More balanced growth is likely to translate into a moderation of the current account as well.This would come without weakening the competitiveness of Germany's export sector. This would be the case, however, if Germany would accept the economic advice to excessively boost its wages to stimulate domestic demand. This would harm employment in Germany and, as a consequence, the economic situation in the entire euro area.So, while considerable progress has been made at the national level, in the deficit countries in particular, much remains to be done. And reforms at the national level could be reinforced by European efforts to strengthen competition, especially in the services sector.However, when it comes to taking action at the European level, other challenges for monetary union are probably even more crucial. The safeguards originally put in place for the stability for the monetary union, the Stability and Growth Pact and the no bail-out clause, failed to prevent the crisis.It also turned out that other macroeconomic imbalances likewise pose a threat to the stability of the euro area: a steady loss of competitiveness, persistent current account deficits, or high levels of private debt.Ultimately, the risk of contagion between countries was also underestimated when the monetary union was established.In response to the crisis, rescue mechanisms such as the EFSF and ESM were put in place, and they did manage to contain the fallout somewhat. But at the same time, the rescue mechanisms have weakened the principle of individual responsibility, as fiscal responsibility has essentially remained national, while liabilities have been partially mutualised.In other words: the balance between liability and control has become lopsided. Yet I believe that this balance is fundamental to the stability of Europe's monetary union. To put it rather bluntly: you would certainly not want to share your bank account with your neighbour if you were unable to control his or her spending.But how do we restore that balance, and put monetary union on a more solid footing? In principle, there are two ways: first, by creating a genuine fiscal union, or second, by making the principle of individual responsibility work.The first option, a genuine fiscal union, would require the member states to relinquish their fiscal sovereignty and cede it to the European level. In such a setting, the mutualisation of future liabilities would be consistent.This step would require a change of the European treaties as well as a change of national constitutions. But judging by the reluctance of governments and electorates to let Brussels have a say in fiscal matters, this avenue seems blocked, at least for the foreseeable future.This leaves us with the second option, making the principle of individual responsibility work better. In order to do so, the Stability and Growth Pact was stiffened and the fiscal compact was introduced.These are steps in the right direction. But the mere existence of these rules will not suffice. As Erasmus of Rotterdam once said: A nail is driven out by another nail. Habit is overcome by habit.Strict and consistent application of the stiffened rules is therefore important. Here, the Commission has a special responsibility. In this context I am worried that the fiscal policy rules have become ever more complex and, in turn, so has monitoring compliance with them. It has now become almost impossible for experts, let alone the general public, to determine whether or not countries are complying with these budget rules.This naturally reduces the binding force of the rules. The binding force of the rules can also be diminished if there is the impression that they are not being strictly interpreted by the Commission. And the assessment procedure gives the Commission greater and more discretionary leeway. Metaphorically speaking, we need to make sure that the Commission does not go beyond its role as a referee and move the goalposts mid-game.Based on past experiences it is clear to me that stiffening the rules alone won't suffice to enforce the principle of individual responsibility. At its core, this principle requires that sovereigns, banks, and investors bear the consequences of their decisions.This implies that it is primarily up to the respective government and its citizens to come up with the revenue required for repaying public debt. This holds, in particular, since high levels of public debt often go hand in hand with substantial private assets. But it also implies that the risk of non-repayment ultimately lies with the investors, since they are the ones who reap the return when things go well. And if the fiscal limit has been reached for real, public debt needs to be restructured without posing a systemic threat to financial stability.The introduction of collective action clauses into sovereign bonds was a first step in that direction. But more steps are needed.The Bundesbank has put forward a proposal for sovereign bonds to include an automatic maturity extension of three years in case a sovereign accesses the European rescue mechanisms. This automatic maturity extension would allow the sovereign in question to tackle its fiscal challenges while preventing investors from bolting. Liability and control would be brought better into balance. The amount of official financial support would be reduced, and time is bought to figure out if the problem is one of temporary illiquidity or insolvency.But ultimately, all these questions boil down to the quip of American economist Allan Meltzer: Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It doesn't work. For the above proposals to work, we need to make sure that the insolvency of both banks and sovereigns is possible without bringing down the financial system as a whole.At the moment, the insolvency of a sovereign or of a systemically important bank is perceived as an unpredictable risk. What do we have to do to make that risk manageable?At the core of the problem lies what is now known as the sovereign-bank nexus. In the crisis, this sovereign-bank nexus developed into a vicious circle: Tottering banks and teetering sovereigns lean towards each other for support, but are in fact pushing each other over.If a large bank or one which is strongly interconnected with other banks runs into difficulties, this can pose a threat to the stability of the entire financial system. The state then often has no other option but to step in if it wants to prevent a meltdown of the real economy. But this rescue can be a huge burden on government finances. This is what happened in Ireland where the need to prop up the financial system pushed the public debt ratio up by nearly 30 percentage points.Conversely, weak government positions can destabilise banks - directly through their exposure to sovereign bonds, and indirectly through worsening macroeconomic conditions. This was the case in Greece.How can we break this doom loop? The strengthened Basel III capital rules are a first step in that direction, as they increase capital buffers and therefore the capacity of banks to absorb losses.The banking union, with its Single Supervisory Mechanism, is another such step. Strict and stringent supervision ensures that tough rules are applied equally to all.In retrospect, heeding Wim Duisenberg's advice when he argued in favour of a European banking supervision in the late 1980s would have paid us all a handsome dividend. The establishment of the SSM 25 years later is testament to his prescience. The SSM is important for severing the link between banks and sovereigns. But to make sure that banks cannot pass on the consequences of their actions to the public, more is needed.As a natural complement to the SSM, an effective restructuring and resolution mechanism has to establish a bail-in regime that clearly assigns how losses are distributed, making sure that shareholders and creditors are first in line. In this regard, the agreement on the Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of failing banks (BRRD) and the agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism three weeks ago constitute progress.But it would be better still if the bail-in regime were to take effect at the time the SRM starts - not one year later as is currently envisaged.The sovereign-bank nexus, however, works both ways. We also have to make sure that worsening public finances do not infect the financial system. The banking union still has a sovereign virus, as Daniel Gros from the Centre for European Policy Studies put it. To strengthen the banking union's immune system, we need to end the preferential treatment afforded to sovereign debt. At present, sovereign bonds are treated by European regulators as being risk-free - an assumption that stands in contradiction both to the no bail out clause and to recent history.We should therefore put this regulatory fiction to rest. Hence, sovereign bonds should be adequately risk-weighted, and exposure to individual sovereign debt should be capped, as is already the case for private debt. An adequate risk-weighting of sovereign bonds would make banks more resilient if the fiscal position of the respective sovereign were to deteriorate. And it would bring spreads more into line with the underlying risk, thus sending a disciplining signal to the sovereign.But sovereign bonds pose a threat to financial stability not only because of preferential risk-weighting. The most important rule in risk management is diversification.Yet when it comes to sovereign bonds, banks all too often seem to neglect this principle. In many cases, European banks hold bonds from one sovereign only - their home country. During the crisis, many banks, particularly weak ones, used the low refinancing costs to buy even more sovereign debt; they made a sort of carry trade. However, a high level of undiversified sovereign exposure is what makes sovereign default a potentially systemic event.Hence, the large exposure regime which caps investments in a single debtor has to be applied correspondingly to sovereigns as well. This might trigger substantial repercussions, but these would be manageable if they were phased in over a transitional period - which would undoubtedly need to be granted.Consistently applying the stiffened rules and ending the preferential treatment afforded to sovereign debt will be instrumental in strengthening the stability of our monetary union. So will the banking union.Currently, much of the support provided to the whole structure hinges on one pillar alone: monetary policy. But this will work only for so long; monetary policy has already done a lot to absorb the economic consequences of the crisis, but it cannot solve the crisis. To say it once again in Wim Duisenberg's words: Don't ask for monetary policy to perform tricks it cannot deliver.Therefore, the best contribution the Eurosystem can make to a lasting resolution of the crisis is to fulfil its mandate: that of maintaining price stability.To avoid potential conflicts of interest between the ECB's mandate to safeguard price stability and its role in banking supervision, changes to the European Treaty will be needed in the medium term in order to strictly segregate these two functions.Klaas Knot said recently in an interview with the German daily Handelsblatt that it was sensible to make use of the ECB's credibility to establish the SSM, but that it should be considered to eventually outsource the SSM from the ECB and to establish a separate institution. And I can only agree with his view.Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.The crisis has laid bare shortcomings at the national level as well as weaknesses in the monetary union's institutional architecture. Repairs at the national level have seen considerable progress, though there is still a long way to go.Like in a marathon, the second half of the course always feels tougher than the first - and one major challenge is to not give in to the growing reform fatigue. But at this point, the weaknesses in EMU's architecture probably pose a more fundamental challenge.The balance between liability and control has got out of kilter. We need to regain that balance if we are to put EMU on a more solid footing.Since a genuine fiscal union is not on the cards - and to me it does not seem to be for the foreseeable future - we need to make the principle of individual responsibility work. Therefore, we need to break the sovereign-bank nexus in both directions. The banking union is an important first step.But we also need to put an end to the preferential treatment afforded to sovereign debt in order to immunise the financial system against sovereign default.To me, these are the piles we still need to push into the ground to provide for a lasting foundation of our monetary union.I now look forward to Governor Knot's take on EMU's most pressing challenges.

"2014-04-08 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","I am honoured to have been asked to speak to you this evening at the 20th German Banking Congress.The film we have just seen illustrates that German Banking Congresses, or bankers' congresses as they used to be called, have always mirrored our country's colourful history.I would like to take the opportunity today to talk about the importance of stable and healthy banks for a stable currency union.Do you remember the Agatha Christie film Murder on the Orient Express?The US businessman Mr Ratchett is murdered on the train from Istanbul to Calais. Detective Hercule Poirot, who happens to be on the same train and is asked to investigate by the director of the train company, a fellow traveller, discovers that the murder victim has twelve stab wounds and is, in reality, the criminal Cassetti. After questioning the witnesses, he ascertains that a number of passengers had a motive to murder Cassetti. He therefore comes to the conclusion that there is not one culprit for Cassetti's murder, but twelve.I am telling you this because the chief economist of the BIS, Claudio Borio, recently said that the search for the culprit for the financial crisis brought to mind the search for the culprit in Murder on the Orient Express. As with Cassetti's brutal murder, for which there is no one culprit, there is no monocausal explanation for the financial crisis.In fact, the contrary is true: an analysis of the root causes of the global financial crisis, as well as the European debt crisis, shows that many are to blame, or should we say responsible.I believe that no one here in this room will deny that there were serious aberrations in the banking sector, which contributed to the crisis. However, central banks and the regulatory authorities also made mistakes.Although the central banks successfully combatted inflation, they provided incentives for risky investor behaviour. Regulatory authorities underestimated the resulting dangers, as did the financial markets, where risk premiums were long at extraordinarily low levels. Politicians trusted in the efficiency of the financial markets and pursued a policy of market liberalisation and deregulation and did not see, or did not wish to see, the risk potential this entailed.Most economists were equally blind to the risks in the financial system, with just a few issuing warnings to the political decision-makers. Claudio Borio, whom I mentioned earlier, and his colleagues at the BIS were among the few to point to the potential for a setback as a result of the rapid growth in the credit securitisation and credit derivatives segments.  If financial market economists did not see the dangers, how were small investors and savers supposed to have been aware of the risks involved in some of their investments, say Lehman certificates? However, even what are referred to as retail clients cannot be absolved from all responsibility, when, for instance, they made deposits with virtually unknown banks and turned a blind eye to potential risks in the search for higher yields.The financial crisis has shown just how fragile the financial system is. And it has become apparent that the financial system is the Achilles heel, as it were, of European monetary union.A stable currency union requires a stable financial system. Banks have a central role to play in the euro area's financial system. The sovereign-bank nexus is a huge obstacle to permanently overcoming the crisis in the euro area.In some countries, banks and governments have manoeuvred themselves into a position of mutual dependence that is a downright vicious circle: if the banks run into difficulties, this raises the risks for the government budget. Where this gives rise to doubts about the solvency of sovereigns, this in turn impacts banks, not only because they then lack a last line of defence, but because they also have large holdings of government bonds on their balance sheets and display a pronounced home bias.During the crisis, and encouraged by crisis measures, many banks, especially in the crisis countries, even upped their holdings of high-yield bonds issued by their home state.The logic is sound as seen from the individual bank's perspective: if all goes well, the bank will pocket a sizeable yield premium, and if the state becomes insolvent, the survival of most banks in this country will be doubtful anyway.In order to return to balance sheet structures that are sustainable in the long term, I believe deleveraging is unavoidable. This is because banks themselves are responsible, first and foremost, for resolving the structural problems in the European banking sector.Euro-area banks' total assets more than doubled between 1999 and mid-2012, due in large part to the exaggerations in the run-up to the financial crisis; they swelled from more than 14 trillion euro to almost 35 trillion euro.In the euro area as a whole, banks are now reducing their assets, though this process has not yet been concluded. While the decline observed since mid-2012 is considerable, at just over 4 trillion euro to date, it reverses just a fifth of the preceding expansion.The high level of non-performing loans as well as the losses the banks are reporting are additional indications that there is still considerable need for adjustment, especially in the periphery countries of the euro area.Moreover, looking at the experiences with debt crises in Scandinavia and Japan in the 1990s, there is much to be said for not putting off the balance sheet repair process.History teaches us that banking crises and financial crises are recurring phenomena; in other words such crises can never wholly be avoided. Nonetheless, the utmost should be done to prevent such serious crises as those witnessed in recent years. Above all, we need sensible and intelligent financial market regulation.On the subject of the lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis, there are remarkable differences in perception between representatives of the financial industry and the general public: while the prevailing impression among the public is that next to nothing has happened, industry representatives are already complaining of an excess of regulation. There has even been talk of a tsunami of regulation.In my opinion, neither is true. Regulation has been materially tightened in numerous instances, but there can be no question of overregulation.Nor have all points on the regulatory agenda been put into practice. What is key is that the steps taken by regulators should always be effective and designed to combat the underlying issues and that the interplay between the various regulatory measures should also be taken into consideration.The stricter capital requirements and new liquidity rules under Basel III, which will be phased in by 2019, have already significantly enhanced financial institutions' internal capital adequacy. On the whole, the regulatory measures have made the financial system more secure and robust. Whether it is now sufficiently secure and robust is a different question.According to the Basel Committee's latest Basel III impact study, the 102 large international banks that were examined had, on average, a common equity tier 1 ratio of 9.5 percent and the 125 other banks had a ratio of 9.1 percent in mid-2013. The target for 2019 of 7 percent common equity tier 1 capital is therefore already more than met, on average.Of course, that does not mean that all banks have already achieved the target of 7 percent plus potential surcharges for global systemically important banks. However, the cumulative shortfall of the large international banks halved in the first half of 2013.The eight large German banks with an international focus that the Bundesbank examined had an average ratio of 8.3 percent as at the 30 June cut-off date, while the 40 smaller banks even had a ratio of 12.8 percent. Large banks' capital requirements also almost halved, from 9 billion euro to 5 billion euro.The 7 percent target ratio includes a new capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percentage points. This buffer will allow losses to be absorbed effectively. It thus goes some way towards resolving the problem which the British economist Charles Goodhart has described as the regulatory paradox.Imagine you arrive at an unknown railway station late at night and there is exactly one taxi at the station's taxi rank, which you wish to take to your hotel. The taxi driver tells you that he is sorry but he cannot take you because the city authorities demand that there must always be at least one taxi waiting in front of the station.Metaphorically speaking, the traditional minimum requirements guarantee that there is exactly one taxi at the taxi rank. However, this capital cannot be used to absorb losses, as hard-hitting supervisory sanctions would be imposed if capital falls below requirements.The new rules ensure that there are at least two taxis waiting. Now, taxi drivers will counter that the more taxis there are waiting for customers, the longer they stand idle, and that is expensive.Bank representatives use a very similar argument when they say that capital is expensive and conclude that a bank's assets should be funded with as little capital as possible. However, the argument should really be that debt capital is cheaper as it currently enjoys tax privileges, which makes equity financing comparatively unattractive.  And there is, I may add, a considerable difference between whether the worst case is having to wait for a taxi or facing stability risks in the financial system. I therefore believe that it is right to create greater capital reserves than regulators are currently demanding in order to make the financial system more robust.A problem that German and other banks have been experiencing not just since the financial crisis is weak profitability; the current low-interest-rate environment just adds to the burden. Poor profitability limits banks' ability to retain earnings and thus their ability to build capital. Measures to improve earnings in the banking sector therefore indirectly also facilitate measures to improve risk absorption.Critics of the Basel capital rules such as Martin Hellwig complain that the risk-based approach of the Basel framework serves primarily to artificially lower capital requirements. In actual fact, the leverage ratio, ie the unweighted capital ratio, of the eight large German banks with an international focus that participated in the Basel III monitoring was just 2.2 percent in mid-2013, which translates into 45 euro of debt per euro of capital. Smaller banks' leverage ratio was as much as 4.3 percent.The planned introduction of a leverage ratio - the target ratio according to Basel III is 3.0 percent - is doubtless a sensible addition to the risk-weighted capital rules. The risk-based approach must, however, remain a key element of the capital rules. Having a leverage ratio as the sole rule would offer banks problematic incentives to take greater risks.I therefore agree with my colleague Mark Carney of the Bank of England who has said, in this context, that it is sometimes good to wear a belt and suspenders to prevent your trousers from slipping.Ladies and gentlemen, the journalist and professor for banking Wolfram Engels once wrote: Bankruptcy is a part of the market economy. This self-evident truth has, to date, been inadequately implemented in the banking sector, however.Large and very interconnected banks especially were, to date, able to count on their survival being systemically relevant and thus guaranteed. However, too big to fail is not compatible with the principles of a market economy, nor is too interconnected to fail.In extremis, banks must be able to fail. For only the possibility of failure guarantees the implementation of the principle of liability. And only the principle of liability ensures that economic agents take responsible decisions.This is not intended to be a plea for small is beautiful. Large international banks definitely have a place in our economic framework. Nor does the sensible ringfencing of risky, speculative business from normal customer business, as proposed by the Liikanen Group and taken up by the European Commission, change this.However, incentives to expand to ever greater size should be reduced. Systemic risk buffers and higher capital requirements for systemically important institutions are instruments which counter this incentive. Their introduction is therefore welcome.In other words, there should be at least three, not just two, taxis waiting at the taxi ranks of large stations, to return to the image I used earlier.However, capital buffers are only a first line of defence to help banks weather adversity better. This is particularly important for banks that would be especially difficult to wind up. Further measures are necessary to ensure that it is, in extremis, possible for large and very interconnected banks, too, to fail.A vital building block in the process of making the banking system more stable is creating the regulatory framework for the orderly resolution of failed banks. To achieve this aim, procedures need to be put in place which allow the principle of liability to be implemented effectively.The EU has made crucial progress recently, with the adoption of a harmonised bank resolution regime (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive) and the decision to create a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). Essentially, the new rules are designed to ensure that banks that run into difficulties in future can be wound up, with their owners and creditors being first in line to foot the bill.The SRM provides expressly for a bank-financed resolution fund only being second in line, while public funds would only be used as a last resort. Despite a number of exceptions in the fine print, which are part and parcel of the process of compromise, the resolution mechanism agreed upon allows a fundamental principle of market economics to be enforced.The Bundesbank welcomes this agreement as an important complement to common European supervision. But we still believe that a treaty change will be needed, all the more so as the decision-making processes seem to be as complex as ever. The aim must be to set up a European resolution agency equipped with clear decision-making structures.A matter which has yet to be decided conclusively, but one that will be of particular interest to you, is the question of which banks will need to pay into the single resolution fund, and how much. An appropriate approach would be to have different contributions depending on an institution's size and its specific risk profile.Banks will be asked to bring the fund up to its target volume of 55 billion euro over a period of eight years, beginning in the year 2016 - an adequate timeframe, in my opinion, for mobilising these funds.It would also be right, in my view, to use the option granted by the SRM Regulation of also counting amounts which banks have already paid into national resolution funds towards their contributions.A European deposit guarantee scheme is not being regarded as a matter of priority at the moment, and rightly so. After all, a joint deposit guarantee scheme would necessarily mean joint liability. But joint European liability would necessitate joint European control, which would require more than the creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism.The ECB is aiming to be ready to launch the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) on 4 November. This will require a mammoth effort by all the parties involved. It is a project that is comparable to the creation of monetary union, but is to be rolled out at seven times the speed. At the current juncture, the ECB together with the national supervisors is comprehensively assessing the balance sheets of 128 banks which, as things stand today, are candidates for direct ECB supervision.If the asset quality review and the subsequent stress test reveal that banks need to be recapitalised, the need for capital will have occurred on the watch of the national supervisors - so you could say it is a legacy issue. It is therefore down to the member states in question to repair these legacy issues before responsibility shifts to the ECB. Private funds should be first in line to address any capital shortfalls. Failing that, it should be up to the member state to recapitalise the bank in question, assuming the latter runs a viable business model.This asset quality review is a major undertaking for supervisors and the banks in question.Yet at the same time, it is crucial for ensuring that the Single Supervisory Mechanism gets off to a credible start in its mission to restore confidence in banks and revitalise lending in the euro area. Hence the strict and demanding standards set by the asset quality review and the subsequent stress test.The assessment represents a huge administrative burden for the banks, so their misgivings are understandable. But if you are looking to paint a complete picture, there's simply no getting round a thorough assessment. The procedure is even being likened to a full physical examination for banks.Before a football club signs a new player, it first subjects him to a thorough medical - and that is more than just a quick once-over.Of course there are some physicians who carry out needless examinations, but a good medical practitioner is mindful of the proportionality of the treatment administered. Proportionality is also the watchword in the asset quality review, though we should not forget that this is the first time such a comprehensive assessment has been conducted.The banking union closes a vulnerable gap in monetary union by contributing to strengthening the financial system. It also helps to loosen the toxic links between sovereigns and banks to some degree.But in my view, further steps will be needed if we are to permanently and effectively sever this nexus. In particular, the preferential regulatory treatment afforded to government bonds and other exposures to the public sector needs to be brought to an end.If government bonds had to be backed by an amount of capital that adequately reflects the inherent risk, and limits were defined for public sector exposures, as is commonplace for loans to private debtors, banks would have much less of an incentive to increase their leverage by investing in sovereign debt. That would also play a key part in improving the stability of our banking system because it would remove an incentive for taking on excessive leverage.It is gratifying and encouraging to hear that Martin Blessing, a leading figure in the German banking industry, recently put forward a similar suggestion, because it indicates that support is on the increase. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble recently also called for this issue to be added to the political agenda.It goes without saying that like Basel III, the appropriate legal framework would need to be phased in incrementally over an extended period of time.As I highlighted at the beginning of today's speech, only structural measures can overcome the structural problems afflicting Europe's banking sector.Monetary policy - and this is something I would like to be quite clear about - cannot resolve these structural problems in the financial sector, for we have neither the tools nor the mandate to do so.Being a central bank we cannot rectify the solvency problems of distressed institutions. But what we can do is combat temporary liquidity shortages.Back in November 2013, the ECB Governing Council, of which I am a member, agreed to continue the full allotment policy at least until the middle of 2015. What this means is that for the time being, banks can continue to draw as much liquidity as they wish, provided they can furnish sufficient collateral. After all, we should not forget that Europe's financial system is centred around banks, and that state of affairs is not about to change any time soon.Successful monetary policy is based on preconditions which it cannot entirely create on its own. A functioning banking system is one of them; sound public finances another.Ladies and gentlemen, the euro area is currently experiencing very low inflation rates that are well below our definition of price stability, which is below, but close to 2 percent. Our projections suggest that the spell of low inflation rates will persist for a time before rates gradually head back towards 2 percent.Given the low inflation pressure, the expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate.At the same time, I would like to stress that the risk of a self-reinforcing deflationary spiral driven by shrinking wages and prices - a scenario which some people are prophesying - is equally remote, despite the current very low inflation rates in the euro area. These are largely explained by diminishing energy prices and the adjustment processes in the crisis countries. As the crisis countries gradually return to economic health, price pressures there are also likely to see renewed momentum. The ECB Governing Council, expecting inflation rates to rise gradually, decided not to loosen the monetary policy reins any further at its last meeting. We are, however, monitoring developments very closely and are potentially prepared to take further measures in order to cope effectively with risks of a too-prolonged period of low inflation.Consideration should also be given to the fact that all the monetary policy measures that are currently on the table would set us on a course into uncharted waters. This raises questions as to the effectiveness of such measures and to the risks and side-effects they might entail. Moreover, the Governing Council members need to respect the boundaries of our monetary policy mandate and the provisions of the European treaties.Another issue about which I have no doubt is that the longer the low-interest-rate policy persists, the greater the risk and the less effective its positive stimulus.This point was also raised by the Association of German Banks recently, and rightly so.Sticking to the low-interest-rate policy for longer than would be needed to safeguard price stability - something which the German Institute for Economic Research inter alia called for recently as a way of making the sovereign debt burden in the euro area more sustainable - should not be an option for us. This would get us into the realm of fiscal dominance and breach our mandate.Above all, we would run the risk of losing the general public's confidence in central banks. They rely on monetary policymakers to focus unswervingly on achieving and maintaining price stability. At the end of the day, we would throw away our most valuable asset, for money without trust is not worth the paper it is printed on.Ladies and gentlemen, I began my speech today by drawing your attention to the film Murder on the Orient Express. And as I have already mentioned, Hercule Poirot discovered that there was not one culprit but twelve. It was a case of lynching - the dead man was guilty of killing a small girl, and each of the twelve was connected to the girl in some way.But Poirot also came up with another possible explanation - that a stranger had boarded the train, committed the crime and then escaped unnoticed. This was the account which the director of the company operating the Orient Express presented to the police, meaning that the true culprits ultimately escaped punishment.Turning to the financial and debt crisis, it would be wrong to put the blame on an ominous stranger. The objective should be to learn the right lessons from the crisis and make sure that similar crises can be avoided in the future.The lessons that need to be learnt for the financial sector are substantial ones, but much has already been achieved.Without stable and healthy banks, there cannot be a stable monetary union.",2014-04-08,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-04-08,"Berlin","Germany","20.

"2014-04-15 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. It is a great pleasure to be here today. In fact, it feels a bit like coming home. And this is not only due to President Fisher's remark that the Fed of Dallas is the Bundesbank of the United States.There are three further reasons why I feel at home over here. First, I was born in the United States and I still carry an American passport in addition to my German one. Second, the state of Texas has a rich German heritage. A heritage that finds its most vivid expression in the numerous Oktoberfests that take place in Texas every year - including the world-famous New Braunfels Wurstfest or 10-Day Salute to Sausage, to use the phrase with which it is promoted. Third, the city of Dallas is very familiar to many Germans of my generation because in the 1980s, we all watched the TV series of the same name.But TV shows and Bratwurst are not the only ties that bind the United States and Germany. The connections between our countries are manifold and profound. These close connections are promoted and fostered by institutions such as the American Council on Germany or the Atlantik-Brücke, of which I happen to be treasurer.In times of crisis, mutual understanding and a trustful relationship are particularly important. And since 2007, we have lived through a succession of crises: a global financial crisis, a worldwide recession, a sovereign debt crisis in the euro area and, most recently, turbulence in some emerging markets.These episodes have once again underscored how closely interconnected the global economy has become. What drives growth and prosperity in good times can easily turn the other way in a crisis. In a globalised world, a problem at one side of the globe can quickly spread to the other side. To paraphrase Winston Churchill: a financial crisis gets halfway around the world before policymakers have a chance to get their pants on.In a globalised world, what happens in the United States is relevant to Europe and what happens in Europe is relevant to the United States. Against this backdrop, I wish to shed some light on the situation in the euro area and offer you an inside view.For nearly four years now, the state of the euro area has been defined by the sovereign debt crisis. And indeed, one might get the impression that this is a crisis without end. However, I have good news for you. The end of the crisis is slowly getting closer and closer. Most importantly, the euro area as a whole has finally left recession. By now, we have seen three consecutive quarters of positive growth, and looking ahead, the outlook for this year and next year is also quite encouraging. Projections by the ECB suggest that euro-area GDP will grow by just over 1 percent in 2014 and by 1½ percent in 2015.And this recovery is not only driven by the core euro-area countries such as Germany. Some of the crisis-hit countries have also finally embarked on the path to recovery. And those which have not can at least see the light at the end of the tunnel.It seems that the efforts to implement structural reforms are gradually bearing fruit. Competitiveness has improved in most peripheral countries over the past few years. Almost everywhere, unit labour costs have fallen substantially. Improving competitiveness in turn drives exports higher. All peripheral countries - except Cyprus - are projected to see some export growth this year. These achievements are reflected in current accounts increasingly reverting to positive balances.And Germany is part of this rebalancing equation. Since 2007, Germany's current account surplus vis-à-vis the euro area has shrunk continuously from 4½ percent of GDP to 2 percent of GDP. As business investment in Germany is projected to pick up in 2014 and 2015, this rebalancing should continue.The progress that these abstract figures reflect is also visible in more concrete events. For example, Ireland and Spain have exited their financial support programmes without any friction. And Portugal is planning to leave its adjustment programme in the first half of this year. All three countries recently returned to the sovereign bond markets at relatively low yields.At the same time, stock markets in these economies have been rising for some time now. These developments underscore the progress that some peripheral euro-area countries have made in adjusting their economies.But we should not get ahead of ourselves. Take a look at Spain which is a country of interest to you in Texas given its relevance for Mexico. Spain is in recession and has an unemployment rate in excess of 25 percent. Yet, it is able to tap the bond markets in the 10-year maturity range at 3.29 percent - not too much above the rate that the US has to pay. This is certainly a situation in which one could start looking for signs of exuberance.However, due to different starting points some countries are naturally more advanced in their adjustment process than others. Especially in Greece further efforts are necessary to manage the turnaround. Against this backdrop, it is a positive sign that the country has made a successful return to the bond markets. Greece raised €3 billion with a five-year bond that was oversubscribed nearly eight-fold, and had to offer less than 5 percent interest.Nevertheless, there are certainly concerns that this success might tempt policy makers to become complacent - not only in Greece but in all the crisis-countries. This must not be allowed to happen.Now, what is the role of monetary policy in this process? Monetary policy certainly helped to prevent the crisis from escalating. Still, there is one thing we should be clear about: monetary policy cannot solve the underlying causes of the crisis.Nevertheless, some observers propose an even more expansionary monetary policy. They are worried about the risk of deflation in the euro area. It is certainly true that current inflation rates are rather low. In March, they dropped again to reach a surprisingly low level. Nevertheless, we do not conduct monetary policy by consulting the rear-view mirror but by looking ahead. And looking ahead, the risk of deflation seems to be limited. And on this issue, the Bundesbank and the ECB agree.The argument rests on three pillars: First, around two-thirds of the drop in inflation is due to falling prices for energy and food. These are exogenous factors and their effects are likely to be temporary. Second, low inflation rates in the euro area are partly the result of necessary adjustments in the crisis-hit countries. These should also be one-off effects. Third, there are no signs of a self-enforcing downward spiral of prices and wages. Long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored at a level that is in line with the ECB's definition of price stability. Private households do not seem to be postponing expenditure in expectation of a further drop in prices. There are no indications of a substantial increase in the savings rate.Thus, while the euro area is certainly in a period of very low inflation, the risk of deflation is very limited. Nevertheless, we are watching the developments closely. And this includes the development of the exchange rate insofar as the strong euro might, at some point, influence price stability.So, even after taking into account the issue of deflation, we can still see the end of the crisis coming closer. However, we have not reached it yet. There may still be some obstacles that could block the way - some of them we can already see, others we cannot see.The latter are what Frank Knight, one of the founders of the Chicago school of economics, called unknown unknowns. A recent example is the political crisis in Ukraine. However, while this is an example of an unknown unknown, it has only limited potential to prevent us from reaching the end of the tunnel. Ukraine contributes only a quarter of a percent to global economic output. Furthermore, the exposure of European banks to Ukraine is relatively small. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements it stands at about US$23 billion.However, we have to see the crisis in Ukraine in relation to Russia, and Russia's relevance for the world economy is larger by far. And after all, the crisis in Ukraine reminds us that geopolitical tensions do have the power to negatively affect the global economy. But this is something central banks cannot solve.A known obstacle that could block our way, on the other hand, is the prolonged period of very low interest rates. But please do not misunderstand me: the current status of monetary policy is certainly adequate. Nevertheless, when interest rates stay very low for a very long time, we may experience unwanted side-effects.One of these side-effects is the search for yield. Investors may eventually increase the risk of their investments to make up for the shortfall in yields caused by low interest rates. And, indeed, it seems that investors already began their search for yield. In corporate debt markets, for instance, valuations are already somewhat stretched. And in the global low-interest rate environment, ambitious valuations may well spread to other market segments.In this regard, the strong recovery in the property markets of some euro-area countries should set us thinking. I think we all remember vividly what happened after the bubble in the American housing market burst in 2007.Take the German housing market, for example. Between 2009 and 2012, prices in large cities rose by almost 25 percent. And, in 2013, they increased by another 8.9 percent. Calculations by the Bundesbank already point to overvaluations in urban areas.Nevertheless, when looking at the German market as a whole, the situation seems less dramatic. In 2013, prices rose by an average of 4.5 percent - a figure that does not give too much cause for concern. Overall, prices in Germany have not yet moved away from fundamentals.For me, warning bells would start ringing if there was a rapid increase in housing prices accompanied by a significant rise in lending. And even more warning bells would be ringing if this rise in credit was accompanied by deteriorating lending standards. Having said that, I can assure you that at this point in time I am surrounded by silence.But it is not only bond markets and housing markets we have to look at. Stock markets are an important issue as well. In 2013, there was only one way for most stock markets to go and that was up. The EuroStoxx 50 increased by 18 percent, the FTSE 100 by 14 percent, the Dow Jones by 28 percent, and the Nikkei skyrocketed by as much as 57 percent.In addition, market volatility decreased, too. In fact, we are witnessing historically low volatility rates, which is something that might have negative side-effects. As soon as monetary policy normalises, volatility is likely to increase. This is not reflected in today's volatility levels and might tempt market participants to neglect the necessity of hedging against changes in interest rates. Let me make it clear: low volatility does not stand for low risks and interest rates will rise again at some point.So, have financial markets entered a new phase of irrational exuberance? Such a verdict is certainly debatable. But financial markets are at least anticipating significant further improvements in economic fundamentals and prospects. And they are anticipating that governments around the world will continue to implement the necessary reforms. These expectations create vast scope for confidence shocks.This, in turn, interacts in an unfavourable way with another risk arising from a prolonged period of low interest rates. A prolonged period of low interest rates could set the wrong incentives. It could encourage banks to postpone necessary balance sheet adjustments. And it might induce governments to postpone necessary structural reforms and the consolidation of public finances.In my view, this could be the biggest threat to the recovery process. The improved outlook together with low interest rates could lead to complacency and reform fatigue. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let it happen because there is still a lot to do to put the euro area back on a solid footing and to truly bring an end to this crisis. Reform at the national level must continue and, looking to the future, reform at the European level is equally important.At the European level, the most important project is the banking union. The banking union is most certainly the biggest step since the introduction of the euro. And it is the most logical step to take. A single currency requires integrated financial markets and this includes the supervision of banks.Consequently, one of the pillars the banking union rests upon is a Single Supervisory Mechanism - that is European bank supervision for the largest banks. Centralising supervisory powers in such a way can foster a comprehensive and unbiased view upon banks. It also enables policy action that is not held hostage by national interests. Thus, it will contribute to more effective supervision and better cross-border cooperation and coordination.However, the banking union does not rest on one pillar alone. A second pillar is necessary to keep everything in balance. This second pillar is the Single Resolution Mechanism. European bank supervision requires European bank resolution - otherwise there would be an imbalance between liability and control.In a wider sense, resolution mechanisms are essential to solve the too-big-to-fail-problem. Large banks must be able to fail without endangering the stability of the whole system. Otherwise, the government would have to step in to prevent a systemic crisis. This would create an asymmetry: If everything goes well, the bank wins. If everything goes downhill, the taxpayers lose. This creates moral hazard for banks, endangers financial stability and threatens public finances.The Single Resolution Mechanism will address this problem. It will allow authorities to restructure or resolve banks without putting taxpayers' money at risk. In the future, whenever a bank fails, resolution costs will have to be borne first by shareholders and creditors. After that, a bank-financed resolution fund will come into play, and only as a last resort are public funds to be used and the taxpayer made to pay.And there is even more to do before the banking union starts. One of the biggest preparatory steps is undoubtedly the Comprehensive Assessment of those banks which will fall under European supervision. This Comprehensive Assessment consists of two elements: a backward-looking Asset Quality Review and a forward-looking stress test.The objective of the Asset Quality Review is to uncover legacy assets in banks' balance sheets that were accumulated while the banks were under national supervision. The objective of the stress test is to assess how resilient banks are to stress scenarios.Any capital shortfalls revealed by the Comprehensive Assessment have to be rectified before the banking union starts. Ideally, this would primarily involve private funds. If private funds should not be available and the bank has a sustainable business model, the respective government could step in. Ultimately, it is a question of who is responsible for past failings in banking supervision - and that is the individual member states.The Comprehensive Assessment will allow the banking union to start with a clean slate. At the same time, it will support the necessary deleveraging of European banks. Balance sheets will eventually be cleaned up and any doubts regarding their quality will be removed. This will improve banks' capacity to lend to the real economy and thus support economic growth. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the Comprehensive Assessment is conducted in a tough and thorough manner.Nevertheless, to ensure that the real economy is properly financed we might have to consider additional options. An important step would be to revive the market for securitisation. Looking at Europe, this is of particular importance as corporate funding in Europe is much more dependent on bank credit than in the US. Meanwhile, European Asset Backed Securities (ABS) had a much better track-record during the crisis than their US counterparts: according to a recent study by the ECB and the Bank of England, the default rate for European ABS from mid-2007 to the third quarter of 2013 was 1.5 percent. This compares to 18.4 percent in the US. It is crucial to make securitised products attractive to investors without exerting negative effects on financial stability.Ladies and gentlemen, I have covered a lot of ground in my speech today. Nonetheless, the central message is straightforward. The situation in the euro area is improving and the end of the crisis is coming closer. However, there is no time for complacency. Risks remain, among them reform fatigue and the side-effects of low interest rates. Thus, we must continue our efforts to put the euro area back on a sound footing.Recently, ECB president Mario Draghi said that 2012 and 2013 were years of stabilisation for the euro area and that 2014 and 2015 may be years of recovery. If we continue down the path of reform, his expectation will prove correct.But as I said at the beginning, the world has become closely interconnected and so, too, have risks and problems. The prolonged period of low interest rates is as much a global problem as it is a European one.And one thing is certain: interest rates will rise again at some point. However, managing this turnaround will prove a formidable challenge. The recent turbulence in emerging markets made this very clear.But in the end, it was domestic problems and a lack of progress in reforms that made some emerging markets vulnerable. To restore investors' confidence, they should address domestic vulnerabilities. This might also help to bring down the exchange rate of the euro, as part of its increase was due to capital being reallocated from emerging markets to the euro area.Although the turbulence in emerging markets does not have the potential to derail the global recovery it shows how sensitive markets are at the moment. There is still considerable scope for negative confidence shocks.Returning to economic prosperity and financial stability requires policy-makers with a stability-oriented mind set - something I do not have to emphasise here at the Bundesbank of the United States. It also calls for mutual understanding and trustful cooperation - qualities that are promoted by institutions such as the American Council on Germany.I am confident that we will eventually be able to leave the times of downs, busts and turmoil behind us. And that we will finally bring an end to this seemingly endless crisis.",2014-04-15,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-04-15,"Dallas","USA","Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas","The state of Europe: End of the crisis or crisis without end?",3093,15.7,4.9,49.3,10.2,"EN"
"2014-05-08 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Danish Economic Association today, and many thanks to Governor Per Callesen from Nationalbanken for making this possible. It is a pleasure to be here.You should know that the Nationalbanken and the Bundesbank have been working closely together for many years now and that we share many views. So let me take the opportunity to thank Per and his colleagues for many years of fruitful exchange.I would also like to use this occasion to say how impressed I am with the Danish - or rather Nordic - model of combining economic flexibility with social security. In my view, this model strikes a balance which could serve as a blueprint for other European countries as well.Thus, from a structural point of view, Denmark seems to be closer to the vision held by John Maynard Keynes. He said: The day is not far off when the economic problem will take the back seat where it belongs, and the arena of the heart and the head will be occupied or reoccupied, by our real problems - the problems of life and of human relations, of creation and behaviour and religion.And Denmark has a number of great thinkers who busied themselves with what Keynes calls the real problems. One of these thinkers is Soeren Kierkegaard. And he said: Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards.Of course, today I am not going to philosophise about life because, unfortunately, Europe still faces some economic problems. Nevertheless, I will apply Kierkegaard's principle to the subject of today's speech: the European sovereign debt crisis.When endeavouring to understand the origins of the crisis, we have no choice but to look backwards. Yet, our policies need to be forward looking. Thus, I will talk about both how the crisis emerged and the challenges that lie ahead.There is, however, one part of the picture that I will have to leave out: the current economic situation in Europe. Why is that? Well, on Thursday the Governing Council of the ECB will meet to take interest rate decisions. A gentlemen's agreement among European central bankers compels us not to discuss any issues related to monetary policy in the week prior to those meetings and I will of course honour this agreement.Thus, all I can say with regard to the current situation is that the end of the crisis is coming closer - slowly but surely. This is also the message of the EU Commission's Spring 2014 Forecast that was published on Monday. Referring to the forecast, Commission Vice-President Siim Kallas stated that recovery has now taken hold.But looking back, the question is: how did we get into that problem in the first place? To answer this question, let us take a look back to 25th March 2010.On that day, Jean-Claude Juncker, then President of the Eurogroup, made a statement on Greece. This statement included the following words: As part of a package involving substantial International Monetary Fund financing and a majority of European financing, euro-area member states are ready to contribute to coordinated bilateral loans.That sounds somewhat long-winded. Put simply, it means that the euro-area heads of state and government were ready to support Greece financially. That statement could be seen as the official start of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, the starting shot so to speak.It wasn't of course the real start. The crisis was not something that happened suddenly, but rather the end of a long road. And the road leading out of the crisis is just as long. It is just as long, but much more arduous, particularly for those countries which are directly affected by the crisis.And everyone agrees on where the road should lead: a stable monetary union. What is controversial, however, is what road we have to take in order to arrive at that destination.And this seems natural as there are a very large number of angles from which it is possible to look at such a complex phenomenon as the sovereign debt crisis. And depending on the angle, it is possible to tell somewhat a different story. The core elements of those stories are always the same, however. We can find them at both the national and the European levels.Let us first take a look at the national level; in other words, the countries themselves. Following the introduction of the euro, a large amount of capital flowed into the countries which are now at the centre of the crisis such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. First of all, that is economically plausible: capital flows from highly developed countries into countries that are catching up economically.In our case, however, the inflowing capital did not finance a sound catching-up process. Instead, it financed house price bubbles in some countries - such as Ireland and Spain. Elsewhere, it funded excessive government consumption - for example, in Greece.The inflowing capital did not fund sound growth: instead, it masked an existing lack of competitiveness and, in fact, made it even worse. And it was precisely these structural problems that were the breeding ground for the crisis.What was the situation at the European level? Here, it was mainly shortcomings in the framework of monetary union that laid the ground for the crisis.In order to understand these shortcomings, it is important to know the particular features of monetary union. The European monetary union is special because it combines a single monetary policy with national fiscal policies.The monetary policy for the 18 countries of the euro area is decided by the Governing Council of the ECB in Frankfurt. However, the fiscal policies of the 18 members of the euro area is a matter for the national policymakers - each country decides itself on its own government revenues and expenditures.Given such an imbalance of responsibilities, the individual countries have incentives to borrow. This incentive to borrow, this deficit bias, was also recognised by the founders of the monetary union. In order to reduce it, they did two things.First, they created explicit rules on borrowing in the form of the Stability and Growth Pact. This Pact was intended to keep a tight check on national fiscal policies.Second, they incorporated the no bail-out principle into the Maastricht Treaty: no euro-area country was to be liable for the debts of another member state.Thus, individual responsibility was to be the guiding principle for fiscal policy in the monetary union. Each country was itself to bear the consequences of its own fiscal policy.These rules were intended to keep borrowing by the euro-area countries within reasonable limits. But rules were not the only means of achieving this. The financial market actors, too, were to ensure that that the euro-area countries did not incur excessive debt.The idea behind this is simple: if a country were to become excessively indebted, it would only be able to borrow on the financial markets in future at very high rates of interest. This means that the country in question would have to reduce its debt to a sustainable level.Yet, neither of these two safeguards worked. Neither the discipline of the financial markets nor the rules were able to prevent individual countries running up excessive debt.Investors on the financial markets tolerated the problems of individual countries for far too long. At the same time, policymakers stretched and sometimes ignored the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.And then, in 2008, came the global financial crisis. Many countries had to rescue their banking systems and support economic activity. And that dramatically drove up their levels of sovereign debt.And, suddenly, the investors on the financial markets seemed to become aware of the problems which some countries were experiencing. Now they saw the high level of sovereign debt, the lack of competitiveness and the risk of contagion effects between the individual countries. In short: they lost confidence in the crisis-hit countries. But this also meant that capital flows dried up - the capital flows that had previously covered up the problems.In order to safeguard financial stability in the monetary union as a whole, rescue packages were set up; first for Greece, then for Ireland, Portugal, for the Spanish banking system and, finally, for Cyprus.At the same time, central banks took various non-standard measures to stabilise the situation.In an exceptional crisis, taking exceptional measures is undoubtedly the right thing to do. However, looking to the future, neither course can provide a permanent solution to the crisis. Neither the rescue packages nor monetary policy can remedy the basic underlying problems that I have just mentioned.In order to achieve that, I believe three things to be necessary. First, government finances have to be put back in order; second, competitiveness has to be improved; third, the framework of monetary union has to be strengthened. Let us look at these three necessities in more detail.Many euro-area countries have very high levels of sovereign debt. Take Greece as an example: even though the country is projected to have a primary surplus this year, total debt keeps growing and stands at 175 percent of annual economic output. Compared to Denmark's 44.5 percent, this is a dizzying number.And in other member states, too, sovereign debt is well above annual economic output. Against that backdrop, reducing government debt has to be an urgent necessity.The associated course of fiscal consolidation has come in for some criticism, however. It is argued that, especially in a crisis, too many austerity measures place an unnecessary drag on the economy. However, a distinction has to be made at this point: in the long term, sound government finances are good for the economy - no-one disputes that. In the same way, no-one disputes that austerity measures can dampen economic activity in the short term.But we should look beyond the present moment and, above all, not confuse cause and effect. What triggered the crisis was the very fact that governments were no longer able to borrow on the markets because they had already accumulated excessive levels of debt. Saving is essential in order to regain the confidence of the markets. That is the only way to eliminate the financing problems.On one point, the critics are right, however: saving is not enough on its own, it is only part of the necessary structural reforms.And that brings us to the second thing that is needed. Not only do the countries have to put their government finances in order, they have to reform their national economies so that they become competitive again. And there is no short-cut to achieve this objective. Monetary policy in particular is not an alternative to structural reforms - this is not only true with regard to the peripheral countries but also with regard to the large countries of the euro area including Germany and France.It is certainly true that reaping the fruit of success comes with a time lag. But experience from Germany - which ten years ago was nicknamed the sick man of Europe - shows that the benefits will come to the fore sooner or later. And with regard to the crisis countries, the benefits are already visible.To sum up: At the national level we see some progress that can be explained by the structural reforms implemented. This progress is not least visible in concrete events. For example, Ireland and Spain have exited their financial support programmes without any friction. And Portugal is planning to leave its adjustment programme just ten days from today. All three countries recently returned to the sovereign bond markets at relatively low yields.Now let us turn to the European level.If we want a stable monetary union, it will not be enough to eliminate the problems at the national level alone. We also have to improve the architecture of the monetary union.I cited the central weakness at the start of my speech: the imbalance between a monetary policy conducted at the European level and fiscal policies conducted at the national level.Basically, there are two ways to realign this imbalance: either the European level gains certain control rights over national budgets. That would mean a deeper political integration. Or we leave control of fiscal policy at the national level. But then the national level also has to assume liability for its policies - that would mean strengthening the Maastricht framework.The first course would amount to what is known as a fiscal union. But that would depend on the countries of the euro area transferring national sovereignty to the European level - for example, by giving the European level the right to intervene in the case of unsound public finances.Giving up sovereignty in this way would be a radical change and require wide-ranging legislative changes nationally and at the European level. More than anything, such changes would need the support not only of policymakers but also of the general public. And, on this point, we should be realistic. It is not possible to identify any willingness to do that at present - not in Germany or in any other country of the euro area.This just leaves the second course of action: that is, an improved Maastricht framework, a Maastricht 2.0. Among other things, that means strengthening the rules on borrowing - the Stability and Growth Pact not only needs teeth, it also has to be able to bite. The rules have since been tightened - now they have to be applied and complied with.A Maastricht 2.0 would also mean taking the no bail-out principle more seriously again. But that calls for the possibility of sovereign default as the ultimate logical conclusion of individual responsibility. Sovereign defaults have to be possible without destabilising the financial system of the euro area as a whole.And that is an important point, because the close link between government finances and the financial system was a major element of the crisis.Basically, this is very much a vicious circle: if public finances run into difficulties, the banks are put under strain- if the banks hold government bonds on their balance sheets, for example.Conversely, if banks run into difficulties, public finances are put under strain. Take the example of Ireland: in order to save its banking sector, Ireland ran up a budget deficit amounting to 30 percent of its economic output in 2010.There are various approaches to breaking through this vicious circle. One of them is the planned European banking union.One pillar of the banking union is joint banking supervision for large banks, the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The ECB is planning to launch the Single Supervisory Mechanism on 4 November. As you can imagine, this is a formidable challenge. It is a project that is comparable to the creation of monetary union but scheduled to be rolled out at seven times the speed.Centralising supervisory powers at the European level will foster a comprehensive and unbiased view upon banks. It will also enable policy action that is not held hostage by national interests. Thus, it will contribute to more effective supervision and better cross-border cooperation and coordination. Against this backdrop, non-euro area countries might also benefit from joining the Single Supervisory Mechanism. For countries such as Denmark the door is open to join and personally, I would be very happy should Denmark, at some point, decide to join the Single Supervisory Mechanism.But all of that cannot entirely rule out the possibility of bank failure. And that is a good thing. After all, the risk of corporate failure is a core element of the market economy.Thus, the banking union cannot rest on one pillar alone. A second pillar is necessary to keep everything in balance. The Single Resolution Mechanism will be that pillar. European bank supervision requires European bank resolution - otherwise there would be an imbalance between liability and control.In this regard, the EU has made crucial progress recently, with the adoption of a harmonised bank resolution regime and the decision to create a Single Resolution Mechanism.The Single Resolution Mechanism will allow authorities to restructure or resolve banks without putting taxpayers' money at risk. In the future, whenever a bank fails, resolution costs will have to be borne first by shareholders and creditors. After that, a bank-financed resolution fund will come into play, and only as a last resort are public funds to be used and the taxpayer made to pay.The Bundesbank welcomes and supports this as an important complement to common European supervision. Most importantly, the banking union has to start with a clean slate. Thus, one of the biggest preparatory steps is the Comprehensive Assessment of those banks which will fall under European supervision. This Comprehensive Assessment consists of two elements: a backward-looking Asset Quality Review and a forward-looking stress test, which also applies to four Danish banks.The objective of the Asset Quality Review is to uncover legacy assets in banks' balance sheets that were accumulated while the banks were under national supervision. The objective of the stress test is to assess how resilient banks are to stress scenarios.Any capital shortfalls revealed by the Comprehensive Assessment have to be rectified before the banking union starts. Ideally, this would primarily involve private funds. If private funds should not be available and the bank has a sustainable business model, the respective government could step in. Ultimately, it is a question of who is responsible for past failings in banking supervision - and that is the individual member states.The Comprehensive Assessment will allow the banking union to start with a clean slate. At the same time, it will support the necessary deleveraging of European banks. Balance sheets will eventually be cleaned up and any doubts regarding their quality will be removed. This will improve banks' capacity to lend to the real economy and thus support economic growth. Against this backdrop, it is crucial that the Comprehensive Assessment is conducted in a tough and thorough manner.Ladies and gentlemenWith regard to the sovereign debt crisis it seems that Soeren Kierkegaard's advice did not fall on deaf ears.Policy makers throughout Europe looked back and understood the causes of the crisis. Looking forward, they drew the right conclusions and initiated the necessary reforms - at the national and at the European level.Against this backdrop, the greatest obstacle we face is certainly reform fatigue. This is something we must not allow to happen. Completing the reforms is the only way for us in the euro area to achieve our objectives of a stable monetary union and a stable euro.This would not only benefit the euro area itself but each and every country in Europe.

"2014-05-14 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at this year's Alternative Investor Conference - I am delighted to be here today.My responsibilities at the Bundesbank have actually changed slightly since I accepted your invitation. As you may know, the Bundesbank appointed a new Deputy President, Professor Claudia Buch, yesterday, and the distribution of responsibilities within the Executive Board has now changed. After being the board member in charge of financial stability for four years, I was assigned responsibility for banking and financial supervision yesterday.Ultimately, though, these two areas have the same overarching aim - they simply approach it from different angles. Their objective is to maintain a stable financial system. And the business of achieving this aim has not got any easier over the past few years.Our world - and, not least, our economy - is becoming more and more interconnected. And a global economy can't function without a global financial system. This makes the financial system more important, yet it is ultimately still a means to an end - it is a service provider for the real economy.In this role, the financial system - or, more precisely, its stability - is a public good. As economists like to put it, there are external factors at play. If the financial system is thrown off balance, this also has a negative impact on those outside it - businesses in the real economy or taxpayers, to name two examples.That is why it is necessary to regulate the financial system in order to safeguard its stability. The need for regulation is beyond dispute: the question is not whether, but how we should regulate. Of course, there are a number of different ways to approach the issue, but one thing is clear: regulation isn't stationary. The financial system is in constant flux, and regulation has to keep pace with it.Regulatory reform is usually triggered by a crisis - and the recent crisis is no exception. It set in motion a fundamental review and reform of financial market regulation. Work on this reform began at a global level in 2008, and it is still underway. Many important measures have been agreed, and some have already been implemented. Yet certain areas still need a lot more work. I would like to discuss two of these issues here today: the too big to fail problem and the shadow banking sector.The too big to fail problem was a key factor in the recent crisis, and it still isn't completely solved. But first let's take a look at the essence of this problem.Participants in the financial system are highly interconnected. If a bank runs into trouble, this will also affect its counterparties. And if the bank in question is particularly large or has an especially high number of counterparties, its woes can destabilise the entire financial system. We saw how devastating this scenario can be in 2008, when Lehman Brothers became insolvent.In such cases, the state may have no option but to bail out the distressed bank in order to prevent an escalation of the crisis. Such bail-outs are, of course, extremely costly; in 2010, Ireland was obliged to spend more than 30 percent of its annual GDP on bail-outs for stricken Irish banks. And these costs are ultimately borne by none other than the taxpayer.But this policy not only comes at a cost to the taxpayer; at a deeper level, it also changes the structure of the financial system. Large and interconnected banks enjoy an implicit state guarantee. If they run into difficulties, they can always count on the state bailing them out - they are too big, too interconnected or simply too important to fail.This encourages large and interconnected banks to enter into high-risk transactions. If these transactions are successful, the bank will reap the benefits; if they make a loss, the taxpayer may ultimately have to foot the bill. Large and interconnected banks therefore intrinsically pose a risk to financial stability. At the same time, this is precisely why they engage in such risk-taking in the first place - which all makes for a dangerous feedback loop.So how can regulation help? One option would be to prevent large banks from becoming distressed in the first place. Notably, the new Basel III capital requirements are an important step in this process. But can they rule out bank failures altogether? And should we even try to do so?My answer to both of those questions is a resounding no. Of course we can't rule out bank failures entirely, and nor should we try. The possibility of a market exit is fundamental to any market economy. Failed business models must make way for better ones, in the process that Schumpeter famously described as creative destruction.What we need are mechanisms that allow even big banks to fail without destabilising the entire financial system.Only then will banks face the real threat of a market exit; only then will we eliminate their implicit state guarantee; and only then will banks have an incentive to be risk-aware in their actions.Without these kinds of mechanisms, we cannot solve the too big to fail problem. And there is still a good deal left to be done, as the markets themselves acknowledge. Recent studies by the IMFand the OECD show that the markets still assume that, if push came to shove, the state would not let big banks go under. And it's true that there are two problems relating to credible resolution mechanisms which have yet to be resolved. First, resolution mechanisms are inherently complex - especially those for big banks, which tend to operate globally. They often have dozens of branches spread across numerous countries. To be able to resolve a bank of this kind, we need international cooperation that is built on solid legal foundations. We have now taken some initial steps towards this goal - through the Financial Stability Board principles at an international level and the agreement to create a Single Resolution Mechanism at a European level. Even so, there is still a long road ahead of us.Second, each bank resolution throws up the same question: who should bear the costs? When a bank is resolved, there have to be sufficient resources available to absorb losses. These resources - known as gone concern loss absorbing capacity, or GLAC - should be sufficient to allow the failed bank to be resolved. In other words, GLAC should help to recapitalise viable components of the failed bank, or a bridge bank. The aim is to preserve the bank's critical functions while avoiding a government bailout or turmoil on the financial markets.GLAC should become to the gone concern scenario what the Basel III regime is to the going concern scenario. And for both we need internationally binding minimum standards which are mutually compatible. The Basel III capital standards have already been approved, whereas a minimum standard for GLAC is currently under development.Ladies and gentlemen, we haven't yet crossed the finishing line in our quest to solve the too big to fail problem. But that is not the only area which needs a lot more work. If we want to safeguard financial stability in future, regulators will need to set their sights beyond the banking system - to the shadow banking system.But I have my reservations about the term shadow banking system. The word shadow usually conjures up images of unsavoury, shady activities. And that is in no way a fair description of the shadow banking system.Still, there's no denying that we have too little data on the shadow banking system, which means that we don't have quite as clear a picture of it as we do of other parts of the financial system.In addition, the shadow banking system is in constant flux: innovations shift its boundaries; activities and participants come and go. To regulate the shadow banking system, we need a definition that does justice to these changes.The Financial Stability Board has therefore opted to define the shadow banking system fairly broadly as the system of credit intermediation that involves entities and activities outside the regular banking system. Put simply, this definition covers bank-like entities and bank-like activities which are not subject to banking regulation.Examples of shadow banking entities include money market funds, hedge funds, asset management companies and financial vehicle corporations. Fittingly, their business is often described as non-bank banking or parallel banking. Examples of shadow banking activities include securitisations, securities lending and repos.Despite the blurred and constantly shifting boundaries, we can attempt to estimate the size of the shadow banking system. The Financial Stability Board, for instance, puts the figure for assets under management in the shadow banking system at US$71 trillion. That would make the shadow banking system about half as big as the regular banking system. However, this global aggregate does not capture major regional differences. For example, in the United States the shadow banking system is about 175 percent the size of the regular banking system, whilst the ratio in Germany is only around 25 percent.As well as the size of the shadow banking system, its rate of growth also varies between regions. In 2012, the system saw its sharpest expansion in emerging market economies, with China recording the fastest growth worldwide. By contrast, the German shadow banking system grew comparatively slowly. Overall, the global shadow banking system has grown rapidly in recent years: between 2002 and 2012, its assets under management expanded by US$45 trillion.This growth could continue into the future. For instance, more stringent regulation of banks may cause activities to migrate to an increasing extent into shadow banking - what is referred to as regulatory arbitrage.However, it would be wrong to attribute the growth of the shadow banking system to regulatory arbitrage alone. Growth is also being driven by demand for the specialised products and services offered by the system. Institutional investors in particular make use of shadow banking products - such as repo trades - as an alternative to traditional bank deposits.In consequence, the effects of shadow banking on financial stability are not entirely clear. On the one hand, the system undeniably fulfils an economic role: it offers alternative sources of funding to enterprises in the real economy as well as to banks, thereby adding to diversification and specialisation. In general, that enhances both the efficiency and the resilience of the financial system.On the other hand, the shadow banking system also harbours risks. If activities are shifted into shadow banking as a result of regulatory arbitrage, then the concomitant risks are shifted too - and thus sometimes moved out of reach of the regulatory access that is actually needed.However, the shadow banking system may be a source of risks other than those deriving from regulatory arbitrage. Shadow banking participants undertake maturity and liquidity transformation, they engage in the transfer of credit risk, and they operate with leverage. This means they carry out a range of bank-like functions which are associated with bank-like risks. At the same time, however, there are two key differences compared to the regular banking system. First, shadow banking participants and activities are not subject to banking regulation. Second, shadow banking participants have no access to central bank liquidity, nor do they benefit from public backstops such as deposit insurance schemes.The consequence of this structure is a latent risk of runs on shadow banking participants. A run may lead to liquidity bottlenecks which can only be cleared by rapid deleveraging. That in turn may contribute to a collapse in prices on the financial markets, and thus exacerbate the problems in procyclical fashion. At the same time, the structure of many of the transactions conducted in the shadow banking system means that the participants are closely interconnected. Thus, contagion effects within the system are highly likely.These systemic risks within the shadow banking system may then spill over into the regular banking system. The latter is linked to the shadow banking system through a number of channels. Partly this is because banks are directly involved in shadow banking. At the same time, many banks are connected indirectly to the system through liquidity facilities, claims on shadow banking participants and common exposures in individual markets.Thus, the shadow banking system may well be a source of systemic risk. Accordingly, it is very high up the G20 reform agenda. In November 2010, the G20 asked the Financial Stability Board and other international standard setters to develop approaches to ensuring better supervision and regulation of the shadow banking system.In this connection, let me be absolutely clear: the purpose of regulation is not to proscribe shadow banking activities or to drive participants out of the market when such activities and participants engender no systemic risk. The sole aim of regulation is to put a brake on systemic risk.There are essentially two approaches: a direct one and an indirect one. Indirect regulation is aimed at the regular banking system and tries to keep a check on its links to the shadow banking system. Direct regulation, on the other hand, takes direct aim at shadow banking participants and activities.In terms of indirect regulation, some progress has been made in the reforms to the Basel framework. For instance, capital requirements for various connections to the shadow banking system were increased - including for risks arising from securitisation and from liquidity facilities for securitisation vehicles. In addition, banking supervisory liquidity ratios may help to stem systemic risk - where macroprudential considerations are factored into defining them.Money market funds constitute one example of direct regulation of participants. US money market funds in particular bear a strong resemblance to banks. For investors, there is very little difference between these funds and a bank account - including access to cash at ATMs. The main problem comes with money market funds which operate with constant share values, such that investor deposits have a constant value. With funds like this, losses are not distributed evenly across all investors. Instead, a first come first served rule applies. Those who withdraw their deposits first get back the full amount, while those who act too late have to accept corresponding losses. This rule makes such money market funds susceptible to runs.Therefore, a shift to money market funds which operate with variable share values is an important step in making the sector more stable - in these funds, losses are shared evenly by shareholders. Regulatory proposals in this regard have now been published in both the United States and Europe. However, these are focused on alternative measures such as capital cushions, liquidity charges and delayed withdrawal for funds with a variable valuation. These initiatives are to be welcomed, but an obligatory shift to variable share valuation would be better.An example of direct regulation of activities is that applying to securities financing transactions.In these transactions, a German bank, for instance, provides a UK-based hedge fund with short-term financing against collateral in the form of securities. In a liquid market, this type of transaction can contribute to a procyclical build-up of leverage. Since the securities furnished as collateral are generally used several times over, this creates long chains of transactions involving many different participants - participants in both the shadow banking system and the regular banking system. This adds to the degree of interconnectedness within the financial system, increasing the risk of contagion effects. To counter this risk, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation at the end of January. Under the proposed rules, securities would only be reusable if the provider of collateral agreed to it. These moves to put a brake on systemic risk in the securities financing markets are without doubt a step in the right direction.Ladies and gentlemenThe financial system needs appropriate regulation so that it can function as a reliable provider of services to the real economy. The crisis laid bare a number of gaps in the regulatory framework applying to the financial system, gaps which we now need to close.We have already come a long way in this, but we have not yet reached the goal. We cannot allow ourselves to come to a standstill, either with regard to the too-big-to-fail problem, or with respect to the shadow banking system and other issues still requiring more work.Standing still would in fact mean falling behind, because the financial system is constantly changing. Thus, regulation is aiming at a target which is forever receding. And that is a good reason to make progress somewhat more swiftly - regardless of whether we are talking about regulation from the point of view of banking supervision or in terms of financial stability.",2014-05-14,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-05-14,"Frankfurt","Germany","Alternative Investor Conference 2014","Financial markets regulation - Standing still means falling behind",2766,18.1,5,45.5,11.2,"EN"
"2014-05-19 - BuBa - Carl-Ludwig Thiele.txt","ich freue mich ebenso wie unser Präsident, Sie hier zum 2. Bargeldsymposium der Deutschen Bundesbank in Frankfurt willkommen zu heißen. Ich halte diesen Austausch von Meinungen und Informationen verschiedener Bargeldakteure für außerordentlich fruchtbar und freue mich über das vielseitige Programm, welches den Barzahlungsverkehr aus den unterschiedlichsten Perspektiven beleuchtet. Im Laufe des Tages werden uns Zentralbanker und Marktakteure ihre Sicht auf das Bargeld schildern. Neben Herrn Präsident Dr. Weidmann sind es das EZB-Direktoriumsmitglied Yves Mersch, der ehemalige Chefvolkswirt der EZB Prof. Dr. Otmar Issing und der Leiter des Zentralbereichs Bargeld Helmut Rittgen, die uns entsprechende Eindrücke aus Notenbanksicht vermitteln werden.Seitens der privaten Bargeldakteure sprechen heute Ludger Gooßens, Mitglied des Vorstandes des DSGV, Hauptgeschäftsführer Stefan Genth vom Handelsverband Deutschland, neu im Amt mit einer herzlichen Gratulation zum Amtsantritt Klaus Müller vom Bundesverband Verbraucherzentrale und Michael Mewes, Vorstandsvorsitzender der Bundesvereinigung Deutscher Geld- und Wertdiensts. Sie analysieren das Bargeld aus der Sicht der Geschäftsbanken, des Handels, der Verbraucher sowie der Wertdienstleister. Ich möchte mich an dieser Stelle bei den Organisatoren des 2. Bargeldsymposiums bedanken, die ein weiteres Mal eine hochkarätige Veranstaltung mit interessanten Rednern auf die Beine gestellt haben. Ich möchte den Barzahlungsverkehr heute weniger aus der Perspektive des Banknotenemittenten betrachten, der sich über die große Nachfrage nach seinem Produkt freut. Vielmehr möchte ich den Fokus auf unsere operativen Tätigkeiten rund ums Bargeld richten. Was ist damit konkret gemeint? Die Bundesbank hat fünf Kerngeschäftsfelder – Geldpolitik, Bankenaufsicht, Finanz- und Währungssystem, barer und unbarer Zahlungsverkehr – und darüber hinaus noch viele weitere Arbeitsgebiete. In einigen dieser Tätigkeitsfelder bestehen die Aufgaben der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter fast ausschließlich darin, auf hohem wissenschaftlichem Niveau zu forschen und zu analysieren, um neue Erkenntnisse zu gewinnen und Entscheidungsträger bestmöglich vorzubereiten. Zu nennen sind in diesem Zusammenhang beispielsweise das Forschungszentrum oder die volkswirtschaftlichen Abteilungen der Bundesbank, in denen ganz überwiegend hochqualifizierte Akademiker tätig sind. Im Bargeldbereich hingegen ist vieles von dem, was wir tun, operative, manuelle und mitunter körperlich anstrengende Arbeit. Man kann hier den Vergleich zum Maschinenraum eines Schiffes ziehen, den ich Ihnen mit einigen Zahlen illustrieren möchte. Betrachten wir zuerst die Beschäftigten als wichtigsten Produktionsfaktor. Während in der Zentrale der Bundesbank die hochqualifizierten und wissenschaftlichen Tätigkeiten dominieren, liegt der Schwerpunkt in den Filialen mit circa 77 Prozent des Personals eher auf den operativen Arbeitsgebieten. Wie äußert sich das im Arbeitsalltag? Nun, Banknoten, Münzen oder auch Goldbarren sind im Gegensatz zu beispielsweise geldpolitischen Analysen physische Produkte, die transportiert, gezählt, bearbeitet und überwacht werden müssen. Allein für die abzuwickelnden Bargeldtransporte – national oder grenzüberschreitend – verfügt die Bundesbank über einige Dutzend Fahrzeuge, mit denen jährlich 1,3 Millionen Kilometer zurückgelegt werden. Was die Bearbeitung betrifft, so arbeiten wir bankweit mit 141 Banknotenbearbeitungsmaschinen, mit denen wir jährlich fast 15 Milliarden Banknoten auf Echtheit und Umlauffähigkeit überprüfen. Das bedeutet, dass wir im Jahr annähernd 15.000 Tonnen Geldscheine bewegen. Rein rechnerisch bearbeitet jeder Filialbeschäftigte somit mehr als 20.000 Banknoten pro Tag. Zum Vergleich: vor mehr als 20 Jahren wurde mit dreimal so vielen Maschinen weniger als die Hälfte des aktuellen Volumens bearbeitet. In der Zwischenzeit haben wir den Maschinenpark durch leistungsfähigere Multistückelungsgeräte ersetzt. Die nicht mehr umlauffähigen Banknoten werden schließlich geschreddert. Hinsichtlich der Schredderquoten von Banknoten müssen wir immer aufs Neue die Balance finden zwischen den Zielen eines qualitativ sehr hochwertigen Banknotenumlaufs – was für hohe Schredderraten spricht – und eines wirtschaftlichen Bargeldumlaufs – was für niedrigere Schredderraten spricht. Jede Banknote, die geschreddert wird, obwohl sie noch umlauffähig bzw. fit ist, belastet letztlich den Steuerzahler. Sie muss neu beschafft werden. Unsere Fachleute arbeiten vor diesem Hintergrund permanent daran, die Maschinen optimal zu justieren. Außerdem entwickeln sie zusammen mit den Herstellern der Banknotenbearbeitungsmaschinen die Sensortechnik weiter. Ziel ist es, dass die Maschinen sämtliche nicht mehr umlauffähigen Banknoten zuverlässig schreddern. Manchmal kommt es aber gerade bei sehr ungewöhnlich verschmutzten oder stark beschädigten Noten vor, dass die Maschinen die Annahme quasi verweigern. Über manche Banknoten kann man zuweilen nur schmunzeln: von Liebeserklärungen bis hin zu aufwändigen Graffitis haben wir schon alles auf Geldscheinen gefunden. Doch letztlich landen sie alle im Schredder. 2013 summierte sich das Gewicht dieser Schnipsel auf 1.000 Tonnen, was fast zwei voll beladenen A 380 Flugzeugen entspricht. Als Dämmmaterial, Brennstoff oder käuflich zu erwerbende Schreddergeldbriketts finden die winzigen Banknotenreste eine neue Verwendung. Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, Sie sehen, die Aufgaben im Bargeldbereich der Bundesbank sind sehr vielfältiger Natur. Vor allem aber werden Banknoten, Münzen oder Goldbarren hin und her bewegt, bearbeitet, kontrolliert und gelagert. Die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter sind dabei enormen körperlichen Belastungen ausgesetzt – sei es durch Lärm, Schmutz oder anstrengende Aufgaben. Für diesen Einsatz möchte ich der Belegschaft an dieser Stelle herzlich danken. Wie steht es nun um die Zukunft des Bargelds? Gestern stand noch in einer großen Sonntagszeitung zu lesen, Angriff auf das Bargeld mit dem Untertitel Banken und Staaten ziehen gegen das Bargeld ins Feld. Ohne Bargeld hätten sie die Kontrolle über uns. Mein sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, um das klarzustellen, die Bundesbank hat keine Präferenzen ob der Bürger bar oder unbar zahlt. Die Zahlungsverkehrsstudie der Bundesbank aus 2011 hat gezeigt, dass circa 53 Prozent der Ausgaben bar bezahlt werden. Dieses betrifft insbesondere den täglichen Einkauf. Seit langem wird dem Bargeld der baldige Tod attestiert; es sei altmodisch, ein Relikt aus vergangenen Zeiten. Diesen Kritikern möchte ich entgegnen, dass der Euro-Bargeldumlauf ungebrochen weiter wächst. Der Banknotenumlauf für das gesamte Eurosystem ist von 806 Milliarden Euro in 2009 um 150 Milliarden Euro auf 956 Milliarden Euro in 2013 gestiegen, also um 18,6 Prozent. Allein im letzten Jahr ist der Umlauf um 43,6 Mrd. Euro bzw. 4,8 Prozent gewachsen. Von diesem Banknotenumlauf wurden von der Bundesbank gut 49 Prozent ausgegeben. Sie versorgt nicht nur den nationalen Zahlungsverkehr mit Geldscheinen und Münzen, sondern leistet einen erheblichen Beitrag für die täglichen Transaktionen am Point of Sale im gesamten Euroraum. Im Wesentlichen fließen diese Banknoten über den Tourismus und die Bargeldtransfers von hier tätigen Arbeitnehmern in andere Länder des Euroraums. Darüber hinaus spielt die Euro-Bargeldnachfrage aus nicht EWU-Ländern eine erhebliche Rolle. Der Flughafen Frankfurt mit einer Vielzahl von Direktverbindungen in diese Ländern und die seit der D-Mark-Zeit bestehenden Geschäftsbeziehungen der Bundesbank mit internationalen Sortenhändlern führen dazu, dass der Euro, insbesondere zur Wertaufbewahrung auch außerhalb des Währungsraums nachgefragt wird. Neben der Zahlungsmittelfunktion stiftet das Bargeld für die Bevölkerung auch einen Nutzen als Wertaufbewahrungsmittel. Letzteres ist für die Menschen gerade in finanziell unsicheren Zeiten von großer Bedeutung, wie wir während der Lehman-Krise im Jahr 2008 bemerkt haben, als die Nachfrage nach Banknoten sprunghaft anstieg. Und auch die Nutzung von Bargeld als Zahlungsinstrument ist trotz steigender Verwendung von unbaren Zahlungsinstrumenten bemerkenswert hoch. Bargeld ist nach wie vor das beliebteste Zahlungsmittel in Deutschland und wird es auf absehbare Zeit wohl auch bleiben. Das Eurosystem gibt nicht zuletzt mit der derzeitigen Einführung der neuen Euro-Banknotenserie ein klares Bekenntnis zur Zukunft des Bargelds ab. Die neuen Geldscheine ähneln optisch der ersten Serie, die 2002 in Umlauf gegeben wurde. Sie wurden jedoch gestalterisch überarbeitet und weisen einige neue und verbesserte Sicherheitsmerkmale auf. Sie sollen somit noch fälschungssicherer werden, damit Bargeld seine Funktionen auch in Zukunft reibungslos und sicher wahrnehmen kann. Seit einem Jahr ist die 5-Euro-Banknote als erste Stückelung der neuen Serie im Umlauf. Die Umstellung verlief in Deutschland weitgehend reibungslos. Einige Probleme gab es allerdings bei der Akzeptanz der neuen Scheine an Parkhaus-, Nahverkehrs- und Verkaufsautomaten. Die Automatenwirtschaft führte dies auf eine zu kurze Umstellungsfrist zurück. Das Eurosystem hat bezüglich der 10-Euro-Banknote, die im September 2014 erscheinen wird, reagiert und den Zeitraum zwischen der Vorstellung der Note und der Einführung deutlich verlängert. Ebenso wurden die Test- und Ausleihmodalitäten erleichtert und die Informationspolitik intensiviert. Ich bin daher zuversichtlich, dass die 10-Euro-Banknote im September erfolgreich an den Start gehen kann. So mancher findet die neuen Geldscheine allerdings so attraktiv, dass er nicht bis September warten kann. Wie Sie der Presse entnehmen konnten, wurden kürzlich in Hamburg einige Hundert 10-Euro-Banknoten der neuen Serie gestohlen, die sich eine Firma zu Testzwecken ausgeliehen hatte. Ein derartiger Diebstahl sollte natürlich unbedingt vermieden werden. Die Tat könnte allerdings in Zukunft als Vorlage für eine herausfordernde Aufgabe in einer Strafrechtsklausur genutzt werden. Ist es Diebstahl oder Hehlerei? Was bedeutet es, wenn die Täter bis zur offiziellen Einführung der Banknoten warten, um dann erst die Beute in Umlauf zu bringen? Sie sehen, ein derartiger Einzelfall wirft juristische Fragen auf. Insgesamt kann man jedoch konstatieren, dass Bargeld in der Vergangenheit, in der Gegenwart und in der Zukunft ein begehrtes Zahlungsmittel war, ist und bleiben wird – und das ganz überwiegend für die rechtschaffenen Bürgerinnen und Bürger. Wie steht es nun vor diesem Hintergrund um die Zukunft des Kerngeschäftsfelds Bargeld in der Bundesbank? Die Bundesbank wird auch in Zukunft den Sorgeauftrag für den baren Zahlungsverkehr, der aus § 3 des Bundesbankgesetzes resultiert, durch eine angemessene Einbindung in den deutschen Bargeldkreislauf wahrnehmen. Angemessen bedeutet in diesem Zusammenhang, dass ein jährliches Banknotenbearbeitungsvolumen von 15 Milliarden Stück Banknoten angestrebt wird. Dies entspricht ungefähr der jährlichen Bearbeitungsleistung der vergangenen Jahre. Wie Sie sehen, ist dies ein starkes Signal nach innen und außen, das die Bedeutung dieses Kerngeschäftsfeld betont. Dieses ausdrückliche Bekenntnis zur Zukunft des Bargelds in der Bundesbank drückt sich auch im Bau der neuen Filiale in Dortmund aus. Damit wird sozusagen ein neuer, moderner, hochleistungsfähiger Maschinenraum geschaffen, in dem das Bargeld noch effizienter bearbeitet werden kann. Dieser wird auf einem 80.000 Quadratmeter großen Areal gebaut und ein geplantes Investitionsvolumen von voraussichtlich deutlich mehr als 200 Mio. € aufweisen. Bei der Konzeption der Bearbeitungsprozesse in der neuen Filiale fließen die Möglichkeiten des technischen Fortschritts hinsichtlich der Automatisierung ein. Wir wollen vor allem die technischen Möglichkeiten nutzen, die sich aus der Größe der neuen Filiale ergeben. So wird die Bank erstmals Hochregallager und fahrerlose Transportsysteme einsetzen. Die Größe des Areals ermöglicht es erstmals, ein Gebäude um die Bargeldprozesse herum zu bauen; das alte Architekturprinzip form follows function kann somit zum Tragen kommen. Bisher mussten wir die Prozesse an eine vorhandene Gebäudestruktur anpassen. Nun können wir optimale Bearbeitungsprozesse entwerfen und verwirklichen. Deswegen kommt dem Geldbearbeitungs- und Logistikkonzept eine besondere Bedeutung zu. Die neue Filiale ist somit baulich und logistisch eine Filiale ganz neuer Art. Das Ziel besteht nicht nur darin, die Kosteneffizienz zu steigern; durch den Einsatz modernster Technik soll auch die physische Belastung unserer Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter gesenkt werden. Nebenbei bemerkt: Im Leistungsangebot für die Bargeldgeschäftspartner wird sich die neue Filiale nicht von den bisherigen Filialen unterscheiden. Was die Öffnungszeiten, die Ein- und Auszahlungsgebinde oder die Belastungs- und Gutschriftskonditionen betrifft, werden auch in Zukunft überall gleiche Rahmenbedingungen bestehen. Nach Inbetriebnahme der neuen Filiale in Dortmund, in der fünf Filialen des Ruhrgebietes aufgehen werden, werden hinsichtlich der derzeit noch andauernden Straffung des Filialnetzes ruhigere Zeiten zu erwarten sein. Die Bundesbank wird ihr Filialnetz dann auf 31 Standorte reduziert haben. Der Vorstand der Bundesbank hat auf meinen Vorschlag 2011 einstimmig entschieden, dass es für den Sorgeauftrag der Bundesbank nach § 3 Bundesbankgesetz erforderlich ist, ein Filialnetz von 31 Filialen einschließlich der neuen Filiale aufrechtzuerhalten. Die Beschlussfassung zur Errichtung der neuen Filiale ist Teil dieses Konzepts. Mit der Eröffnung der neuen Filiale wird die Konsolidierung des Filialnetzes abgeschlossen sein. Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, Sie sehen, der Bargeldbereich der Bundesbank entwickelt sich weiter und wird moderner und effizienter. Die ungebrochen hohe Beliebtheit und Nutzung der Banknoten und Münzen verlangt auf der anderen Seite auch, dass wir wachsende Anstrengungen unternehmen, die Verwendung von Bargeld wissenschaftlich zu analysieren. Die Forschungsergebnisse sollen uns dabei helfen, auch in Zukunft die Anforderungen der Marktteilnehmer an den Barzahlungsverkehr zu erfüllen bzw. diese aktiv mitzugestalten. Daher bauen wir auch unsere think tank Anstrengungen aus. Derzeit läuft die dritte Erhebung zum Zahlungsverhalten in Deutschland, deren Ergebnisse nächstes Jahr publiziert werden sollen. Außerdem veranstalten wir in diesem Jahr die zweite wissenschaftliche Bargeldkonferenz. Der Austausch von Forscherinnen und Forschern aus vielen Ländern soll dazu beitragen, die Zukunft des Bargelds zu gestalten, ebenso wie das heute stattfindende Bargeldsymposium. Sie sehen also, dass wir uns hinsichtlich aller Facetten, die der Umgang mit Bargeld mit sich bringt, weiterentwickeln wollen. In diesem Sinne wünsche ich allen Anwesenden einen informativen und von viel gegenseitigem Austausch geprägten Verlauf dieses Tages. ",2014-05-19,"BuBa","Carl-Ludwig Thiele",2014-05-19,"Frankfurt","Germany","2.

"2014-05-19 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","Ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian poet Johann Nepomuk Nestroy is once said to have wittily remarked: The Phoenicians invented money - but why so little?I cannot guarantee that we will have come up with an answer to this question by the end of the day. However, what I can say is that I am pleased to open today's event and therefore wish to welcome you warmly to the Bundesbank's cash symposium. It is the second of its kind - the first was held in 2012 - and is intended to promote professional and personal exchange between the various cash handlers.The professional activities of most of the people in attendance here today revolve around cash. However, cash naturally accompanies the everyday lives of you as individuals as well as the general public - for it is one of the few things that nearly everyone is likely to have on his or her person at all times. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but at least enough so as never to be completely out of money.Cash not only continues to be the most popular and widely used medium of payment for shopping in Germany, but is also a central bank's most visible product. Banknotes and coins have a concrete touch and feel to them and are physically tangible, which is not the case with other central bank products - such as monetary stability.Ladies and gentlemen, in his satirical essay Brief Outline of the National Economy published in 1931, Kurt Tucholsky noted sarcastically that Where money comes from is unknown. It is there, or not - mostly not. The fact that banknotes are now almost always issued by central banks and circulated through commercial banks is easy enough for the average citizen to understand. But that does not exhaustively describe central banks' role in the cash cycle by any means.In order to understand this role, it is important to also answer the more fundamental question of what exactly money is. In economics terms, the shortest possible answer to this question is that money is what money does. All sorts of objects can function as money if they can be used as a unit of account, a medium of payment and a store of valueAnd a stroll through the history of money yields plenty of examples. Throughout the various cultures, objects as different as cowrie shells in the South Seas, arrowheads and gold powder in Japan and, of course, coins, which were first struck by the Lydians in Asia Minor around 700 BC, have served as money.Even today, coins remain part of our cash. As do banknotes, which, for their part, became accepted as a form of payment only in the 19th century. Earlier attempts to install paper money generally quickly turned into a fiasco. Too much money was printed; paper money was then no longer accepted.Today, coins and notes are the sole legal tender. This means that, in legal terms, their acceptance is mandatory provided the parties to the contract have not expressly agreed any other form of payment.In the real world, the acceptance of cash in daily economic transactions, however, is not  based on this legal obligation. This is clear when we remember that, even in periods of runaway inflation, the acceptance of domestic notes and coins was mandatory, too. In such times, however, many people resorted time and again to alternatives, replacing inflationary money with other payment media considered more valuable for everyday transactions.Today's exchange of goods based on monetary payment is therefore based, first and foremost, on confidence among the public that they can use the money obtained - which, in the case of banknotes, means pieces of printed paper - to make purchases themselves. The functional viability of a currency therefore hinges on public confidence in the value of the money.Independent, stability-oriented central banks are the main anchor of confidence. This works in two ways. One is that central banks need to ensure that the currency issued cannot be reproduced at will by anyone - that it is as counterfeit-proof as possible and therefore always genuine. The other is that central banks maintain the currency's purchasing power. The success of such a policy hinges crucially on the central bank's credibility as a guarantor of stable money.The stability of our currency, the euro, depends not just on public confidence in the Eurosystem's stability orientation but also on conditions which the Eurosystem cannot itself create. These conditions include healthy governmant finances, competitive member states and a well-functioning regulatory framework.With regard to the confidence aspect, the extreme escalation of the situation in the government bond markets observed in the summer of 2012 ultimately reflected massively shaken confidence in the sustainability of various member states' government debt. The sovereign debt crisis is therefore, at the core, a crisis of confidence. In terms of market indicators - such as the yields on government bonds or yield spreads over investments regarded as safe - much of the severe damage to confidence seems to have been repaired. However, it is too early to declare the crisis over. The very high unemployment rates in many of the crisis-stricken countries, sadly, tell an entirely different story.In this context, we have to be aware that the structural problems at the root of the crisis built up over the space of many years. Accordingly, not only considerable effort but also much stamina will be necessary to surmount these problems, and thus the crisis, over the long haul. Metaphorically speaking, the actual solution to the crisis is akin to a marathon, and not to a sprint. Although a considerable portion of the entire course has already been covered, the finish line is still quite a ways ahead.It is precisely the crisis countries that need to commit to using the improvement in the financial markets to make further decisive progress along the road of consolidation and reform and not, for instance, to stop and take a breather.Given the depressingly high unemployment rate in the countries particularly hard-hit by the crisis, it is necessary to keep working on developing the foundations needed for robust growth and sustained employment gains. This includes measures to improve the investment climate and to make the labour market more flexible. In addition, the weaknesses in the banking system need to be fixed. Moreover, there is a need for many member states to take action with regard to public finances.The reinforced fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are a key anchor with which to keep fiscal policy in all member states on a sustainable path of stability and growth. The objective must be to make these rules more binding in future and thus more effective than they had been before the sovereign debt crisis.In view of some critical comments, one cannot emphasise often enough that the Stability and Growth Pact in monetary union is by no means an end in itself, but follows a distinct logic.The stability pact takes account of two factors. For one, it reflects the economic knowledge that a stability-oriented monetary policy has to be complemented by a fiscal policy that is similarly oriented to stability in order to be successful in the long run. After all, experience shows that political pressure on central banks regularly rises in line with public debt levels. The aim of such pressure is to mitigate the burden of public debt through lower interest rates.However, a monetary policy that is oriented to government's funding needs and not to monetary stability can lead to higher inflation sooner or later. Higher inflation, though, is always at the expense of those who are least able to escape from it. To be more concrete: the cost of accelerating inflation is particularly borne by ordinary people.The other factor is that the Stability and Growth Pact takes account of the particular principle of the structure of monetary union that national fiscal policy has remained the responsibility of the individual member states whereas the single monetary policy, naturally, is decided by a central body.This union of decentralised fiscal policy and single monetary policy entails the risk of unwelcome developments in individual countries' public finances weighing on the single monetary policy and at the same time imposing a financial burden on the other member states. In a monetary union, there is, so to speak, an inbuilt incentive of sorts to run up excessive debt. This incentive derives from the fact that one country can partially pass on the adverse effects of its unsound fiscal policy to the other member states. The interest rate rise that accompanies the borrowing has a less severe impact on the highly indebted country than would be the case without monetary union. The experience of the past few years has certainly shown in all clarity that the risks of excessive indebtedness are not just theoretical in nature.In order, above all, to counteract this risk, the fiscal rules contained in the stability pact represent an inherent stability-policy pillar of monetary union: a pillar which, over the medium-term, creates the conditions not only for monetary stability, but also for economic prosperity. Over the medium and long run, sound government budgets and economic growth, in fact, are not mutually exclusive - quite the contrary.The European Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, will assume a key role in ensuring that the euro-area member states stick to the fiscal policy path of conformity with stability. However, it is at least as important for each and every individual member state to be aware of the value of sound public finances and to behave accordingly - especially also with an awareness of responsibility for the stability of the monetary union as a whole.All countries are being called upon here, but particularly the large countries. Their behaviour sends a strong signal, and they therefore have to be aware of their particular responsibility and also act accordingly. The restoration of compliance with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact must not be permitted to become a target which is put off ad infinitum. Fiscal consolidation agreements need to be adhered to.This has nothing to do with a saving or austerity dogma but simply reflects the fact that lasting confidence in fiscal policy is hard-won and needs to be defended time and again.The disciplining effect of the capital markets for fiscal policy will be an important factor. In the past, the capital markets have not always exercised this function to the fullest. This, too, was revealed by the crisis. It is therefore important to reinforce the principle of independent fiscal policy responsibility built into the founding architecture of monetary union. Those who have control over fiscal policy decisions also need to bear the consequences. That is the only way to ensure sound public finances, especially in monetary union.Ladies and gentlemen, public debate has recently also been permeated by another topic: the euro's exchange rate. In this connection, one can increasingly hear calls for monetary policymakers to take on a more active role with regard to exchange rates. This is associated with the desire for monetary policymakers to, wherever possible, ensure that the euro's external value is maintained at a level regarded as appropriate and, if need be, to act decisively to avert a potential further appreciation.As we know, such debate and the attendant demands are not new. These are mostly based on the idea of using monetary policy means to devalue a country's own currency in order to promote growth and employment.In order to strengthen growth and employment in the euro area over the long run, however, the member states will have to ensure competitive economic structures. Put loosely, the exchange rate is like the well-known peppermint drops from the packet: If they're too strong, you're too weak.Since the beginning of monetary union, euro-area monetary policy has been primarily geared to maintaining the currency's purchasing power - and for good reason. The euro's exchange rate, however, is not an objective of the single monetary policy. After all, an exchange rate target could very well come into conflict with the price stability mandate. All parties who are now raising the spectre of political exchange-rate targets need to be aware of this.In addition, a unilateral focus on exchange rates would also be difficult to conceive for the monetary policy of a large currency area, as targeted devaluation of the domestic currency could always trigger opposite reactions from other currency areas. This would end up leaving all countries involved worse off than before.However, the exchange rate - like other economic factors - is relevant to the Eurosystem's monetary policy inasmuch as exchange rate movements can impact on the movement of price levels within the single currency area.We are currently in the midst of a period of exceptionally low inflation in the euro area, which will probably last for some time to come. The ECB Governing Council will therefore also observe further exchange rate developments very carefully in its monetary policy decisions.In light of the public debate about the movement of the euro's exchange rate, we must not overlook the fact that interest rates in government bond markets in the euro-area member states have dropped again considerably in the past few weeks. One of the factors behind this development seems to be that international investors are shifting their investment portfolios and increasingly returning their funds to euro-area countries. This also appears to include investments precisely in those countries hit particularly hard by the crisis.This change in capital investment patterns appears to have contributed to the rise in the euro's external value while at the same time perceptibly easing funding conditions. The short-term dampening impact of a currency appreciation is offset by the positive growth effect created by more favourable funding conditions. Over the medium to long term, the expansionary funding impact is likely to prevail. It would therefore be short-sighted to look only at exchange rate movements without taking into account the stimulating impacts of falling government bond yields.Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to take something into account: the time schedule. I have spoken a lot about confidence. I am therefore confident that you will forgive me if I've exceeded my allotted time limit somewhat. I hope you all have a successful symposium, in which you will obtain new knowledge from the various talks and have a lively exchange of information and opinions at the panel discussions.",2014-05-19,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-05-19,"Frankfurt","Germany","2.

"2014-05-22 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","I would like to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak to you at today's annual reception of Deutsches Aktieninstitut. I would like to use this occasion to talk about the importance of capital markets. Given that I am speaking before an audience of capital market experts, I shall try to avoid the danger of telling you what you already know and focus instead on the macroeconomic view of capital markets as seen by a central banker.First, however, I would like to congratulate the winners of the University Prize, who are being honoured here today.They approached the subject of capital markets from different angles, analysed it from a scientific perspective and obtained valuable insights.In macroeconomic theory, economists traditionally assume the ideal state of a perfect capital market. Such a market is characterised by a high level of efficiency. This is, of course, based on assumptions that are not necessarily realistic. Economists, too, are aware of this - or at least most of them are.You may be familiar with the dialogue between the two economists crossing the road. One of them says: Look. There's a one hundred euro note lying there. The other one replies: If a one hundred euro note were lying there, someone would have picked it up by now, and walks on.Economists' faith in the efficiency of the markets is sometimes measured against reality and found wanting. The financial crisis, too, has sorely tested this faith in the markets' efficiency. This applies especially to the financial markets. In other words, the same markets that were previously regarded as being particularly efficient, as information spreads quickly in these markets and can therefore be promptly priced in by market participants.However, it has become evident that market participants do not always act rationally. In addition, markets are not completely transparent and do not function smoothly at all times.Eugene Fama's Efficient Market Hypothesis was, of course, criticised long before the financial crisis. Way back in the 1980s, Robert Shiller, who last year  was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics jointly with Eugene Fama, characterised the Efficient Market Hypothesis as one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought. However, it was the financial crisis that gave wider credibility to the critics of financial market efficiency.The crisis clearly demonstrated how fragile and how susceptible to crises the financial system as a whole really is. So what conclusion should we draw from this insight?In my view, it would be quite wrong to jump to the conclusion that the macroeconomic utility of stable financial markets is now questionable. We must take care not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Nor should the public discussion about financial stability let us lose sight of the benefits of a modern financial system.The aforementioned Robert Shiller takes a similar view. In his book Finance and the Good Society, he writes: Finance, despite its flaws and excesses, is a force with the potential to help create a more prosperous and more equitable society.There is much to suggest that a developed financial sector is good for a country's welfare and economic progress. Whether this tends to encourage the convergence or divergence of incomes is a hotly disputed point and a subject of the current debate on the role of capital markets.However, the examples of Iceland, Cyprus and Ireland have clearly illustrated how vulnerable a country with an oversized financial system can become.But there is also evidence outside the experience of financial market crises suggesting that further growth in the financial sector above a certain threshold can harm aggregate productivity. One factor in this context that should not be underestimated - and which was pointed out by James Tobin some 30 years ago - is the fact that the well-paying financial sector snaps up many of the best talents from the real economy. Hence the larger the financial sector, the greater the lack of talent in the real economy.While several studies have concluded that the banking sector has innate thresholds which, if exceeded, can damage the course of economic development, recent studies indicate that the jury is still out on the question of whether similar thresholds exist for capital markets. For example, a recent BIS paper found that a further increase in financial market activity - measured by share turnover - beyond a certain point no longer contributes to economic growth or may even inhibit growth.But there is no need to be as pessimistic as the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, who, at the height of the financial crisis, was quoted as saying that the only useful financial innovation in the past few decades was the invention of the ATM.After all, there are also studies that find no evidence of such a threshold in the capital markets. Any attempt to assess the macroeconomic importance of capital markets solely on the basis of empirical studies of their growth-promoting impact would surely overstate the meaningfulness of such studies. Instead, a more comprehensive approach is necessary to address this issue.But first, let me present four core hypotheses regarding the importance of the capital market from a central bank's perspective, on which I will then expand in the course of my speech. Developed capital markets are instrumental in providing investors with a broad range of investment products, enabling them to select the best risk-return mix in their particular case. Key determinants of developed capital markets are liquidity, transparency and integrity. From the point of view of corporations, developed capital markets ensure a broad range of financing sources. This makes capital market funding an important and welcome supplement to bank borrowing for firms. A stronger role for equity capital would be desirable, not least in Germany. Investor protection is essential. It contributes to making the capital market attractive to broader groups of investors. The best form of investor protection is a broadly based system of general financial education. However, it is also crucial to ensure that products are sufficiently transparent. It is not the responsibility of central banks to provide investment advice or to protect investors against losses. A monetary policy approach that was forever willing to clean up the mess after financial market bubbles have burst would create the wrong incentives. The primary objective of monetary policy is to safeguard price stability; financial stability ought to be ensured mainly through macroprudential instruments along in tandem with effective regulation and supervision. Capital markets have an important disciplining function, especially with regard to fiscal policy.In the run-up to the crisis in the euro area, the capital markets did not always live up to this role. The institutional framework of monetary union should be structured in such a way that capital markets can perform their disciplining role effectively.When talking about the economic significance of capital markets, it is useful to distinguish between the investor's and the issuer's perspective. For this reason, I will first focus on capital markets as an investment opportunity, and specifically in terms of their attractiveness to retail investors. Unlike bank deposits, capital market products offer retail investors a useful vehicle for widening their spectrum of investment. Equities and bonds enable broad sections of the population to benefit from an enterprise's commercial success. At the same time, however, these chances go hand in hand with risks of incurring losses.Moreover, given Germany's ageing population, it is important that retail investors turn more towards the capital market since market-based supplementary private pension plans will become increasingly necessary. The financial crisis has not changed this situation one iota. A key requirement, of course, is that individuals should invest their savings wisely by diversifying them across a broad range of capital market products.According to the German Investment Funds Association BVI, savers who regularly invested in European mixed funds over the last 25 years doubled the value of their stake, which works out at an average nominal return of 5.2  percent. Investments in German equity funds yielded as much as 6.6  percent per year, albeit at a greater risk. Less risky bank and insurance products could not have generated such gains.Needless to say, such calculations always depend on the particular type of investment and timeframe being considered. Short-term investments in the share market can, for example, result in big losses. However, losses become less and less frequent, the longer the time horizon of the investment. Survey data compiled by Deutsches Aktieninstitut indicate that the number of shareholders and equity fund investors in Germany relative to the general population has fallen by around one-third since its peak. In 2011, 20  percent of respondents held shares or equity fund units. By 2013, the percentage had dropped to less than 14  percent.This low shareholder participation rate is, however, in no way confined to Germany, as is attested by the Eurosystem's Household Finance and Consumption Survey, which presents comparable data for the whole euro area. In the economic literature, this phenomenon is referred to as the stock market participation puzzle.One striking finding of the Household Survey is that willingness to participate in the capital market is greatly dependent on income and wealth. Among the top ten per cent of income earners in Germany, 46  percent of households hold mutual fund units and 32  percent own shares, the middle twenty per cent of earners report holdings of just 22  percent and 8  percent respectively, while the bottom twenty per cent have equity holdings of just 11  percent and 2  percent respectively. Households' wealth shows a similar picture.Naturally, wealthy households are clearly in a much better position to follow the maxim of only investing money in the stock market that you do not need in the short term. Yet that does not mean that direct shareholdings and mutual fund investments are the preserve of the rich. In particular, medium-income families and individuals, who are typically savers, are missing an opportunity to diversify their investment income.So this raises the question: why do 86  percent of Germans turn their back on the equity market?On the one hand, I think this is one of the lingering after-effects of the bursting of the New Economy bubble. The euphoria surrounding the New Economy prior to its demise - and here I am thinking especially of the Deutsche Telekom IPO, which was marketed as an investment for the man and woman in the street, attracted many Germans to the stock market for the very first time, only to see the value of their shares plummet subsequently. And, of course, the recent financial crisis has also scared people off investing in the capital markets.On the other hand, we have a comparatively sound pay-as-you-go statutory pension scheme in place in Germany. The currently planned improvements for certain groups of pensioners may well make the statutory pension scheme appear even more attractive. But this popular perception runs counter to the reality, namely that the statutory pension scheme will progressively be less and less able to maintain people's living standards in old age.However, another problem might be a general lack of financial awareness among the population. People who cannot tell the difference between a share and a bond and who have difficulty in calculating percentages are likely to steer well clear of capital market products in the belief that they had best not burn their fingers.Alternatively, they might well be lured by products promising maximum safety plus sky-high returns which, however, ultimately fail to deliver on both counts.Henry Ford is said to have commented that It is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. Germany's President Joachim Gauck takes the opposite view. Speaking at the German Banking Congress, he noted that If you want to understand where prosperity comes from and to maximise the reward while minimising the risk, you need to do your homework and brush up your financial skills. And you need to forget the old idea that money is not a subject for polite conversation.That is why it is important to enhance the general public's understanding of financial and economic matters. Achieving progress in this area is a joint objective of the Bundesbank and Deutsches Aktieninstitut, albeit with a differing focus. The Bundesbank strives to educate the population in issues related to money, currency and central banking, to which end it has considerably extended the amount of information provided on its website, whereas Deutsches Aktieninstitut is geared more to conveying basic capital market knowledge.I share Christine Bortenlänger's belief that retail investors would invest more in equities if they had a better economic education.The planned introduction of a financial transactions tax is counterproductive to the development of an equity culture in Germany. It will tend to make investment in the capital markets less attractive.The introduction of a financial transactions tax is intended to achieve several aims, both fiscal and non-fiscal. One objective, for example, is to make the financial sector pay a share of the costs of dealing with the current financial crisis, and another is to discourage transactions that are regarded as having a destabilising effect. An additional, very important aim is, of course, to generate extra revenues for the public budgets.The problem with trying to bail in the financial sector to bear a share of the costs is that the tax will not necessarily hit those who are supposed to be paying it. This was summed up somewhat sarcastically in a commentary in the German daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which read Anyone who believes that banks will bear the cost of the financial tax probably also thinks that cauliflowers grow in supermarkets. The reality is that the financial sector may well simply pass on the tax burden to its customers, and thus to the real economy and to retail investors.The intended steering effect with regard to risky transactions can be achieved more effectively and more directly by other instruments. One example that comes to mind is the regulation of high-frequency trading. It already applies with legal force in Germany and will be introduced throughout Europe as part of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).The financial transactions tax is most likely to achieve the intended fiscal goal of boosting public revenues. But doubts are warranted in this case, too. If only a small number of countries end up collecting the tax in the end and major financial centres, in particular London, opt out, the windfall gains are likely to be small as this would encourage tax evasion.The Bundesbank has therefore consistently advocated that the costs and benefits of such a tax should be weighed up carefully. If the tax has to be introduced at all, then the objective should be to achieve the broadest possible introduction at international level.Ladies and gentlemen, the current situation on the European capital markets is undoubtedly also being influenced by the macroeconomic fall-out of the crisis in the euro area and the corresponding response of policymakers and the Eurosystem. The economic recovery in the euro area is moderate, but still fragile. And inflation is currently very low, significantly below 2  percent.European monetary policymakers have combatted the crisis using a wide-ranging combination of conventional and unconventional measures. Keeping the key interest rates low is appropriate, given the subdued inflation outlook and the sluggish economic recovery.Yet although the risk of deflation is very small, an extended phase of very low inflation can likewise have negative implications for the European economy. The ECB Governing Council has therefore clearly signalled that the key interest rates are likely to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.I can understand that the historically low interest rates are annoying for many savers, particularly as the real interest rate, ie the rate of return after deducting inflation, is negative for many safe forms of investment. However, it is not the responsibility of central banks to guarantee savers a minimum return. Our job is to safeguard price stability.While the low-interest-rate environment is putting a strain on savers, it is simultaneously benefiting business people or home-builders, as they can obtain cheap loans, or employees, whose jobs would be endangered if the crisis were to escalate, or shareholders, who are investing in the economy.Of course, we do not make monetary policy for the stock exchange. Nor is it the task of monetary policy to protect capital market investors from losses. As I mentioned earlier, a monetary policy approach that is always guaranteed to step in and pick up the pieces whenever a financial market bubble bursts actually creates moral hazard in the capital markets. The principle formulated many years ago by the celebrated German economist Walter Eucken, namely that those who reap the benefits must also bear the costs, applies in this case, too.Does this mean that monetary policymakers should sit back and do nothing when financial imbalances begin to build up?No. Monetary policy instruments should be deployed if the financial imbalances begin to pose a risk to price stability. However, interest rate hikes are always rather a blunt instrument when it comes to counteracting imbalances in individual market segments. Macroprudential instruments promise greater accuracy and should therefore build the first line of defence against such risks to financial stability.The bull market of recent months has not altered the fact that the portfolio decisions of German retail investors since the financial crisis have been shaped by risk aversion and liquidity preference. They are therefore still favouring the accumulation of financial assets in low-risk investment vehicles, such as bank deposits or insurance products.However, in a low-interest-rate environment, in particular, there will always be badly informed investors who are enticed by the high coupons in very risky and illiquid investments. Elke König, the head of Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), therefore offers the advice You should invest at least as much time in making investment decisions as you do in purchasing a smartphone.Investors must not only look at the possible returns but must also take due account of the risks involved. It is now the task of investor protection to ensure that issuers provide adequate information about the chances and risks of their products.Investor protection is important. It not only serves to protect the consumer but also to boost the attractiveness of the capital markets. However, it would be in nobody's interest if investor protection were mainly to get bogged down in greater bureaucracy.But capital markets do not just offer attractive alternatives to bank deposits. They also offer firms interesting forms of external financing, as an alternative or a supplement to bank loans - which brings me to the topic of capital markets as a financing instrument.Capital markets offer enterprises access to funding, which they can use to develop and create jobs, for example. They enable firms to grow and innovate, thereby creating welfare gains.  That being said, the advantages of bank loans should not be overlooked either.As I mentioned earlier, the information we have is not complete. Instead, capital users are normally better able to judge the risks and opportunities of their investments than capital providers. Relationship banking, in particular, helps to overcome the problem of information asymmetry.After all, relationship banks are especially interested in obtaining information about these important customers' financial situation. This applies, in particular, to an economy like Germany's, with its large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, that often produce niche products - otherwise known as hidden champions.Capital market financing allows firms to broaden their funding base.Euro-area enterprises are increasingly turning to the capital markets for funding. Over the last few years, this has mainly taken the form of bond issuance, while equity issuance is rather weak. So enterprises are breaking away from the banks to a certain extent.They are not always doing so voluntarily - some banks are having to reduce their balance sheets. But surveys such as the ifo credit constraint indicator show that, on the whole, German firms are not finding it difficult to obtain bank loans.Nevertheless, many enterprises are taking advantage of the unusually low interest rates to diversify their funding structure, especially since risk spreads on long-term corporate bonds with a BBB rating over German Bunds are extremely low.However, banks continue to play a very important role in both the German and the European financial system despite the growing capital market orientation, which is particularly striking in comparison to the United States. The proportion of total bank lending to non-financial corporations relative to their total debt (debt securities and all loans) is around 51  percent in Germany, 46  percent in Spain and 42  percent in the euro area as a whole. In the United States, this ratio stands at 11  percent.The share of bank borrowing as a source of corporate financing in all the countries mentioned has been on the decline for several years, even since before the crisis. However, because banks remain important financial intermediaries, the mostly contractionary trend in lending, which in some euro-area countries is also associated with banks' need to deleverage, may hinder the upturn. This is because many enterprises rely on bank loans.Against this background, it is important to ensure that euro-area banks are resilient. The aim of carrying out an asset quality review for banks prior to the launch of the Single Supervisory Mechanism is to identify particular risks. An adequately capitalised banking system is essential if lending is to pick up again in Europe.In light of this weaker lending trend, however, measures to revitalise the securitisation market are also being discussed. This could stimulate lending to small and medium-sized enterprises in some euro-area countries, for example. However, I do not consider reviving this market as one of the primary tasks of a central bank.To quote a recent article in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the word 'securitisation' still evokes feelings of panic five years after the outbreak of the financial crisis. After all, securitised sub-prime mortgage loans are considered to have fanned the flames of the global financial crisis. It became evident that the capability to trade risk created incentives for excessive risk-taking, which in turn threatened the stability of the financial system.Even so, the securitisation of loans and other financial contracts can in fact be worthwhile and useful from a macroeconomic perspective if there is sufficient transparency and the risks are broadly diversified. It is first and foremost a regulatory task to lay down guidelines that allow the securitisation markets to develop without posing a risk to financial stability in the future.However, hopes of a revival of the securitisation market should not be too high: the very heterogeneous structure of the SME sector and the large information asymmetries between lenders and enterprises entail high firm-specific monitoring costs for lenders.Ladies and gentlemen, when talking about the capital markets as a financing instrument, we must not forget a very important player: sovereigns.Euro-area governments have issued bonds worth over seven trillion euros, just under a quarter of which were German bonds.The financial crisis illustrated how seriously a withdrawal by investors can affect governments' funding. This disciplining effect of the capital markets is instrumental in helping monetary union to function properly. The capital markets have not always performed this function in the past, an insight which also became clear during the crisis.The significant fall in long-term interest rates in some euro-area countries over the last few months has also reduced these countries' borrowing costs. However, there is a risk that market valuations may be running ahead of the adjustment processes. The current long-term yields on some European government bonds already appear to have factored in the required adjustment gains to a certain extent. This creates great setback potential. It is therefore all the more important that policymakers ensure that the necessary progress is actually achieved. One may justifiably question their determination to see this through to the end.To ensure that monetary union remains a stability union, it is important to reinforce the principle of national fiscal responsibility built into the founding architecture of monetary union.  Those who wish to keep control of their fiscal policy decisions must also bear the consequences. This is also an essential precondition for the capital markets to have a disciplining effect.Ladies and gentlemen, this brings me to the end of my speech.There is no doubt that capital markets perform important macroeconomic functions. The increasingly important role of the capital markets as a source of corporate financing is a positive development, particularly as they diversify firms' funding structure and make them less vulnerable to crises.By not participating in the capital market, retail investors are missing opportunities to share in business success. Where this is due to a lack of knowledge and understanding, financial education as provided by organisations such as Deutsches Aktieninstitut can help to gradually increase the participation rate.Balanced rules to protect investors and measures to secure financial stability are necessary and in the interests of all capital market participants.Finally, I would like to thank you for listening to my arguments and remarks.

"2014-06-11 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you, Ambassador Ammon, for hosting this event here at the German Embassy in London. I am happy to have the opportunity to officially thank the Bundesbank's departing representative, Mr Jakob Orthacker, and to welcome his successor, Ms Julia Becker.I am particularly happy that Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, is here today. Thank you, Jon, for your remarks.Now let me say a few words on financial regulation and the need for international cooperation. My argument begins with the idea that a global financial system requires global regulation. To push this idea further, I would define the term global in at least three dimensions and argue that regulation should be consistent in all of them.First, regulation needs to be consistent across jurisdictions. This is necessary to provide a level playing field and reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage. Against this backdrop, recent regulatory initiatives in some countries indicate that the balkanisation of the regulatory space represents a genuine risk. We have to be aware of that.Second, regulation needs to be consistent across sectors. This is again necessary to prevent regulatory arbitrage. In practical terms this means that we have to deal with the shadow banking system. Consequently, the G20 have moved shadow banking high up on their agenda.Third, regulation needs to be consistent across asset classes. Take the regulatory treatment of government bonds as an example. I cannot see a single good reason why banks should not have to back government bonds in their balance sheets by capital, but I see many reasons why they should - not least the objective of breaking the sovereign-bank nexus.Financial regulation that is consistent along these three dimensions will help to make the financial system a safer place.However, while being a safer place in the aggregate, the financial system is not necessarily a safe place for individual banks. After all, we live in a market economy and creative destruction is a central element. Individual banks must be able to fail like any other enterprise.This must also hold for large banks which are often labelled too big to fail. To allow them to fail without destabilising the entire system we need resolution mechanisms. And here again, we have a global dimension. Banks that are deemed too big to fail are globally operating enterprises; resolving them requires a great deal of international cooperation.I think it is obvious that to make the financial system a safer place we have to cooperate in regulation, in supervision, and in the resolution of banks.However, these are not the only challenges we face. Last week, the ECB Governing Council took far-reaching decisions in reaction to the long period of very low inflation rates. It lowered the key interest rates for refinancing operations to 0.15% and cut the interest rate on the deposit facility to -0.10%. At the same time, it decided to conduct a series of TARGETed longer-term refinancing operations aimed at improving bank lending to the euro area non-financial private sector.While the decision of last Thursday was appropriate given the present economic environment, we should now analyse the effects of these decisions before starting the next round of monetary policy easing. And let me make one thing clear: Monetary policy has played a very important role in fighting the crisis but it cannot solve the euro area's problems.Another challenge we face concerns the United Kingdom and Germany, in particular. Both our countries are confronted with rising property prices and with the overarching question of whether there is a bubble building up. At least in Germany, we do not see a bubble at this point in time. Price increases are focused on large cities; for the country as a whole prices rose by a moderate 4.5% last year.Nevertheless, further monitoring and in-depth analysis are certainly necessary. And in this regard, the Bank of England certainly leads the way. Although the structures of our property markets differ in many respects, there is still a lot we can learn from each other's experience. Thus, I highly value the cooperation between the Bank of England and the Bundesbank.In any case, international cooperation always starts at the personal level. This is where our representatives in London come into play. Their task is to build networks, to share information and ideas, to explain the Bundesbank's positions and to facilitate cooperation.For the past three years Mr Orthacker has filled this position here in London. And judging from the distinguished crowd gathered today, he has done an excellent job. I would like to thank him personally and in the name of the Bundesbank for his service.I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome his successor, Ms Julia Becker. She is an expert from the Bundesbank's Financial Stability Department and has considerable experience in market infrastructures and related regulatory issues. Some of you have already met her, and I am certain that she will be a worthy successor to Mr Orthacker.",2014-06-11,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-06-11,"London","UK","Farewell for Julia Becker","Financial regulation as a global challenge",833,16.6,4.9,47,10.6,"EN"
"2014-06-12 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","It is a great pleasure to be in this wonderful and picturesque Mediterranean town. So thank you very much for the kind invitation to give a speech at this conference dinner.You will not need reminding that today marks the beginning of the World Cup football tournament in Brazil. Kick-off of the opening match between Brazil and Croatia is in less than two hours' time. With this in mind, I will try to be brief.Over the next month, football will be at the centre of attention all over the world. National football teams are promoting their own national identity. According to a German sports economist, there is a high correlation between a national football team's performance and a country's reputation. The teams are contributing significantly to the branding of nations.For now, at least, nobody would even dream of fielding a European Union team, even if it were considered to be unbeatable. I am quite sure that people continue to feel as nationals rather than as Europeans - at least where football is concerned.Rivalry in football, however, does not imply that there is no European team spirit. Nor does it suggest that the European project is not one of the greatest ideas in post-war times. The European idea is still an appealing one. And despite all prophecies of doom concerning the crisis in the euro area, European integration remains attractive.This has been demonstrated, not least, by the accession of Croatia to the European Union as of 1 July 2013. By becoming a member of the EU, Croatia has also expressed its willingness to join the European Monetary Union one day, when the convergence criteria have been fulfilled. And the intention of Lithuania to introduce the common currency as of 2015 shows that joining the euro area is still considered attractive.For the time being, the crisis in the euro area has slipped from the focus of public awareness. Nevertheless, it is too early to claim victory over the crisis in the euro area. Even though financial markets might suggest otherwise, the crisis is far from over.In particular, the sovereign bond yield spreads of the euro-area countries most affected have decreased significantly over the past two years. The fall in long-term interest rates has reduced those countries' borrowing costs considerably.Markets are rewarding adjustment progress in the stressed countries. It is clear to me, however, that the decline in sovereign bond yield spreads has also been supported by central banks' actions. The ECB's announcement of conditional but unlimited purchases of sovereign bonds has - unsurprisingly - calmed investors' fear of losing money.You may know that I was not in favour of this measure. While sovereign bond purchases are a widely used monetary policy tool, they are not without risks. They bring monetary policy very close to monetary financing of governments, which could undermine the central bank's ability to maintain its mandate of price stability.Monetary policy may face the danger of being dragged and driven by fiscal policy, and find it very difficult to free itself. The more so as governments become increasingly accustomed to bond purchases that keep the interest rates low. In this sense,  sovereign bond purchases may act like a sweet poison for the governments. The rude awakening may come when the purchases are reduced or stopped altogether.One particular problem with sovereign bond purchases in a monetary union is that they redistribute risks among the taxpayers of different countries. Any such decisions, however, should be taken by democratically elected governments and parliaments.The rallying markets are also being sustained by exceptionally easy monetary policy conditions the world over. Nevertheless, there is a risk that market valuations may be running ahead of the adjustment processes.The current long-term yields on some European government bonds already appear to have factored in the required adjustment to a large extent. This, however, creates a setback potential. It is therefore all the more important that policymakers ensure that the necessary economic progress is actually achieved. Their determination to implement reforms is pivotal. In any case, low interest rates do run the risk of creating incentives to postpone necessary reforms. Thus, the current environment necessitates an even stronger political will.There is no question of there being a quick fix to eliminate the causes of the crisis. Considering that the risk potential built up over many years, it is obvious that it will also take time to reduce it.The question is: How do we best go about making EMU more resilient?As a starting point for the analysis of the crisis, it is helpful to recall the institutional set-up of the European Monetary Union.When EMU was established, monetary policy was centralised while fiscal and economic policies remained in national hands. This set-up created vulnerabilities.It gave rise to a deficit bias, allowing the costs of fiscal imprudence to be partially shifted to other countries. If the fiscal situation in one country is unsustainable, this implies repercussions for the monetary union as a whole.Moreover, abandoning the national currency in favour of a single currency has two major implications. First, member states cannot regain lost price competitiveness by depreciating their currency against their trading partners' currencies and internal devaluation as a substitute is much more painful.And second, each member state issues debt in a currency not of its own making. Fiscal discipline is therefore of the essence and even more important than in a country that has its own national currency. This applies to an even greater extent, as there are no explicit fiscal transfers among governments.However, although fiscal transfers were deliberately ruled out, the central banks' balance sheets can serve as a conduit for shifting risks among national taxpayers. This undermines both the countries' individual fiscal responsibility and the central banks' independence.The founding fathers of the euro clearly foresaw the risk of unsustainable public finances for a stability-oriented monetary policy. Therefore, precautions in terms of fiscal rules were put into place to safeguard sound public finances. They took the form of the no bail-out clause, the Stability and Growth Pact and the prohibition of monetary financing of government deficits for the reasons I have just mentioned. As it turned out, however, these precautions were not sufficient to prevent the crisis.The introduction of the euro and the associated disappearance of exchange rate risks led to strong capital flows to countries which previously had high interest rates. Unfortunately, the capital inflows were not always put to productive use; banks and capital markets failed in many cases to allocate the money efficiently.Instead of financing productive investment, they shifted money into booming real estate sectors, for example. And the governments of some member states missed the opportunity of lower interest rates to consolidate public finances. Instead they enjoyed a more relaxed budget restriction.Capital inflows also enabled higher wages while, at the same time, productivity growth was weak. This resulted in rising unit labour costs and so undermined price competitiveness. Economies became less competitive on export markets, leading to large and persistent current account deficits.They suffered from a sudden halt in external funding during the financial crisis when lenders reined in their risk appetite and fled from risky investments to safe havens. Current account deficits as well as budget deficits became hard to finance - so hard that private funds had to be substituted by public funds.Fiscal stabilisation measures by the euro area countries, the EUand the IMF as well as central bank operations by the Eurosystem helped the stressed countries to bridge the finance gap and to prevent the financial system of the euro area from collapsing. However, while this bridge saved the economies from an immediate and tough adjustment process, it did not remedy the underlying problems of the crisis.In order to foster the groundwork of EMU, three challenges have to be met.The macroeconomic adjustment process has to be continued. This adjustment process has to be accomplished primarily in the deficit countries, but the other countries - including Germany - face challenges, too.Regarding the adjustment of the euro-area periphery countries, remarkable progress has been made so far. Current account deficits and public deficits have been reduced significantly and structural reforms on labour and product markets have been implemented. Nevertheless, the necessary adjustment has not been completed yet.In footballing terms, I would say the half-time whistle has been blown but there is no time for a break. And let's not forget that the second half is usually more exhausting than the first, and we may even have to go into extra time.Actually, there are signs of growing reform fatigue and rising reluctance to implement further austerity measures. However, it is crucial to stay on the ball.In this respect I also wish to look at the large euro-area economies which have significantly lost competitiveness. Both France and Italy need to implement structural reforms to make up for these losses and thereby act as a role model for the crisis countries as well as for all other EU countries.The second requirement for a stable monetary union is a more resilient financial system.Owing to regulatory weaknesses, the financial system acted as an amplifier of the crisis. It has become apparent that the financial system is the Achilles' heel of European monetary union. Without a sound banking system there will be no stable monetary union.The establishment of a banking union including a single supervisory and a resolution mechanism provides the opportunity to make the financial system more resilient and to boost investors' confidence.At the current juncture, the ECB together with the national supervisors is comprehensively assessing the balance sheets of the banks which are candidates for direct ECB supervision. I agree with Jaime Caruana, the General Manager of the BIS, who recently said, The asset quality review is a great opportunity to spur the necessary balance sheet adjustment. This chance must not be missed.The banking union closes a vulnerable gap faced by EMU in helping to strengthen the financial system. However, the banking union is not sufficient to strengthen the institutional architecture of EMU.Rather, we need a fundamental reform of the EMU framework. And this is the third challenge that has to be met to make EMUmore resilient. Let me elaborate on this point.The implementation of the Maastricht framework was not able to save the euro area from the crisis. One of the underlying reasons for this insufficiency is that the rules were too strongly focused on fiscal policies, while their implementation was too weak.It should be kept in mind that Germany and France were the driving forces behind the Stability and Growth Pact reform about a decade ago which turned the Pact into a toothless tiger. With hindsight, they scored an own goal with their efforts. Another flaw in the framework was the restricted credibility of the no bail-out rule. If the markets had believed in the rule, we would not have experienced such a strong convergence of sovereign bond yields as we saw prior to the crisis.When the EMU framework was established in the early 1990s, the risk of contagion among euro-area member states was clearly underestimated. Financial markets were significantly less developed at that time. The credit default swaps market, for example, did not even exist back then. That may help to explain why fiscal firewalls were not deemed necessary when the EMUframework was established.While the rescue measures that were established later, such as the EFSF and the ESM, managed to contain the fallout somewhat, they weakened the principle of individual responsibility. Fiscal decision making has essentially remained national, while liabilities have been partially mutualised. In other words, the balance between liability and control has become lopsided. This balance, however, is fundamental to the stability of the monetary union.But how do we restore that fundamental balance, and put monetary union on a more solid footing?In principle, there are two options. The first way is to create a genuine fiscal union; the second way would be to confirm the Maastricht framework, which essentially means making the principle of individual responsibility work better.The first option, a genuine fiscal union, would require the member states to surrender their fiscal sovereignty in favour of the European level. In such a setting, the mutualisation of future liabilities would be consistent.Such a giant step towards a fiscal union would require considerable changes to the European treaties and the national constitutions as well. To be honest, however, I do not see the willingness of national governments to let Brussels have a say in fiscal matters, and the results of the recent elections for the European Parliament suggest that the electorates do not support such a shift either. Against this backdrop, this avenue seems blocked, at least for the foreseeable future.This leaves us with the second option: making the principle of individual responsibility work better. In order to do so, the Stability and Growth Pact was tightened and enhanced by an early warning system for macroeconomic imbalances. A fiscal compact was introduced according to which member states committed to incorporate balanced budget rules into their national legislation.Regarding the effectiveness of those changes, I would refer to the English proverb the proof of the pudding is in the eating. In other words, it is not clear yet whether the new rules do really bite.It will be crucial that the European Commission applies the stiffer rules strictly and consistently. Unfortunately, fiscal policy rules have become highly complex and, in turn, the scope for interpretation has grown. The assessment procedure gives the Commission greater and more discretionary leeway.However, if France for example were allowed, for the third time, to postpone the correction of its excessive deficit, this would severely undermine the credibility of the new Stability and Growth Pact. If I may use another football metaphor, the Commission should stick to its role as referee and not try to move the goalposts mid-game.To make EMU more resilient, a confirmation of the Maastricht framework goes beyond tightening fiscal rules. Making the principle of individual responsibility workable means making governments, banks and investors feel the consequences of their own actions. Hence, a credible no bail-out rule is needed.A credible no bail-out rule, however, would ultimately require that an orderly insolvency regime for governments exists. As long as a sovereign default is impossible owing to the implied risk for the stability of the financial system, investors in sovereign bonds can expect to be bailed out.In order to make such a state insolvency bearable, we need a robust financial system with sufficient loss absorption capacity and one which is not too closely tied to the government.The so-called sovereign-bank nexus is a huge obstacle to permanently overcoming the crisis in the euro area. During the crisis, many banks, notably in the euro-area periphery, raised their exposure to domestic government bonds; in doing so they tied their fate even more closely to that of their national government.This development was assisted by the preferential regulatory treatment of government bonds. It includes the zero risk-weighting of government bonds issued in local currency and the lack of exposure limits.In order to strengthen the banking union and the monetary union, I believe we need to end this preferential treatment of sovereign debt over a reasonable period of time. Sovereign bonds should be adequately risk-weighted, and exposure to individual sovereign debt should be limited, as is already the case for private debt.Ladies and gentlemen,The French writer François Fénelon said, The more you say, the less people remember. Moreover, I promised to be brief. So let me conclude.According to econometric studies on the history of World Cup football tournaments, the advantage the home team has is statistically significant - no surprises there. Looking ahead to tonight's match, this is bad news for the Croatian team, since it is playing against the host country of the World Cup.It is further shown that a positive relationship exists between a country's population and its performance in World Cup tournaments. So these statistics are against Croatia, too. What's more, Brazil leads the World Cup all-time table, while Croatia is ranked 27th. Brazil is the favourite to win the competition.On the other hand, football is incalculable. You never know how a match is going to end. That's what makes it so appealing. There are plenty of surprises in the history of World Cup football tournaments. I remember, for example, when Germany was beaten 3-0 by Croatia in the quarter final of the 1998 World Cup in France. So there are reasons to be optimistic.Pope John Paul II said, Amongst all unimportant subjects, football is by far the most important. But even if football is basically unimportant, as John Paul II claimed, it is nevertheless enjoyable for the players and it entertains the spectators greatly.In contrast to that, the resolution of the crisis in the euro area offers an enjoyment factor of close to zero and its entertainment value is also limited.If European policymakers succeed in overcoming the crisis and making EMU more resilient, it would certainly not trigger the same euphoric celebrations as a World Cup victory. Nevertheless, it would be hailed as an important achievement, not only from a central banker's perspective, and it would be for the benefit of all.In particular, it would finally allow central banks to shed their role as decision makers of last resort and, thus, to return to their normal business. Moreover, it would help to preserve the independence of central banks, which is a key precondition to maintaining price stability in the long run.",2014-06-12,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-06-12,"Dubrovnik","Croatia","20.

"2014-07-03 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","I am delighted to be here at this year's Economic Conference and would like to thank the Economic Council of the CDU for their invitation.The crisis has thrust monetary policy into the spotlight. The fact that not one, but two monetary policymakers have been invited to today's event reflects the growing importance attached to monetary policy.Monetary policymakers nowadays are sometimes cast as superheroes. Some are dubbed rock stars, others hailed as alchemists, and there has even been mention of new masters of the universe. Others, meanwhile, want to abolish central banking as a public institution altogether given their mistrust of what they see as an overabundance of power, supporting instead competition between private currencies.An op-ed piece in the Austrian newspaper Die Presse once put forward the view that monetary policy was a kind of soap opera - and a boring one at that. At least it was for the occasional viewer. On the other hand, the writer went on to say, monetary policy was probably the world's most important soap opera. After all, it decided the fate of the world economy.Wikipedia defines soap operas as serial dramas in which the protagonists are usually in constant interaction with each other. And that is undoubtedly true for monetary policy - protagonists in the world of European monetary policymaking get together once a fortnight, most recently earlier today in the ECB Governing Council, as well as at many other joint occasions.According to Wikipedia, other typical features of soaps are their trivial storylines, the fact that the protagonists are often more important than the events themselves, and that the roles offer sufficient potential for conflict. Judging by what the media says sometimes, it's easy to think that things are much the same in the world of monetary policy.But I don't see myself as a protagonist in a soap opera, and I think my colleagues would certainly agree with me that monetary policy isn't designed to offer shallow entertainment. Its job is to safeguard price stability - in good times and in bad.Before I move on to talk about the future regulatory framework of the euro area, I would first like to quote the head of state of a crisis country in the euro area:Our country is facing gigantic challenges. Our future and that of our children are at stake. Millions of people are unemployed; many already have been for years. The (federal and state) budgets ... are in an unprecedented critical condition.Have you got any idea who that head of state might be? The Spanish king, perhaps, or the president of Greece or Portugal?No, it was in fact Germany's federal president. Or, to be more specific, it was federal president Horst Köhler in his televised address on 21 July 2005, in which he announced early elections in Germany.Seen from today's perspective, it might appear absurd to categorise Germany as a crisis country. But a decade ago, this assessment was certainly not out of the ordinary.The Economist magazine ran an article on Germany in 1999 under the heading The sick man of the euro. The article made the following point: ... the biggest economic problem for Europe today is how to revive the German economy.And the situation was to worsen still further in the early years of the new millenium. For many years, Germany recorded some of the worst growth rates in the euro area. Unemployment climbed to nearly five million in 2005.It was only later that the economy emerged from its malaise, and it did so with a vengeance. The improvement in Germany's labour market - which was also dubbed the German miracle - was anything but a wondrous occurrence. In fact, it was the outcome of shrewd entrepreneurial decisions, moderate wage policy, greater flexibility in pay policy conditions, and not least fundamental labour market and social reform.You don't need me to tell you that the title of sick man of Europe is an award which often changes hands. Other countries are currently the reigning champions in this discipline. Germany, meanwhile, is seen as an economic powerhouse at the heart of the euro area, making it one of the cornerstones of efforts to rescue the euro.And this solidarity is not entirely a selfless act - after all, Germany has a vested interest in preserving the long-term stability of the euro area.Ladies and gentlemenIt is crucial that we maintain the euro area as a union of stability. If the crisis countries fail to rectify the imbalances that have emerged, the euro area will remain vulnerable to crises. And if that happens, another comparison with a soap opera - this time by the Financial Times' Martin Wolf - might turn out to be true. He wrote: The crisis of the eurozone is likely to be a very long-running soap opera.If the euro area is to quickly put the crisis behind it, the sluggish and highly indebted countries will need to press ahead with their efforts to place their economies and public finances on solid ground.Their endeavours have indisputably borne some fruit. Structural budget deficits have contracted sharply, as have current account deficits. Aggregate unit labour costs have fallen substantially, with the exception of Italy, not to mention France. This has sent price competitiveness sharply higher in many countries, boosting their exports.Greece, to name but one example, is attracting an increasing number of tourists. 2013 was Greece's most successful year as a tourist destination, and the country is heading for another record number of tourists in 2014. In Spain, meanwhile, exports are back on an upward trajectory, growing by 8 percent over the past 12 months. Intermediate and industrial goods are some of the country's most important exports. Thus, exports have made an important contribution towards overcoming the recession.That's the good news. But it should not mask the fact that the adjustment process is still far from over. Simply put, it's more of a marathon than a sprint. Tenacity and perseverance are called for, particularly in the second half of the course.Yet a glance at the sovereign debt markets would suggest that the finishing line has already been crossed. Risk premiums on sovereign bonds issued by crisis countries have plummeted to such an extent that it has never been cheaper for Spain and Italy to raise capital.Disregarding the fact that bond yields are being depressed by the loose monetary policy stance worldwide, the markets are pricing in the progress which the crisis countries will make in future in adjusting their economies. That is not without risk. First, there is real potential for a setback if this advance expression of confidence proves to be unfounded. Second, the relaxation in the markets and the expansionary monetary policy are dulling the enthusiasm for reform in the ailing countries.That's why it's all the more important that expectations are met and that further reforms are not just announced but actually put into practice.Germany is an important role model in this respect. What Germany has accomplished offers a vivid demonstration for its partner countries in the euro area that structural reforms pay off.At the same time, I would like Germany's current economic and social policy to set more of an example. I'm thinking particularly of the option allowing individuals who have paid into the pension insurance system for a long period of time to draw a full pension at the age of 63.After all, the decision made just a few years ago to progressively raise the standard retirement age to 67 served as a model for countries in which the pension systems were likewise feeling the strain of an ageing population. Logically, raising the retirement age was part of the agreed stabilisation programme in three of the four programme countries.So the signalling effect of retirement at 67 was blurred to a certain degree, and pension policy seems akin to the famous dancing procession of Echternach - two steps forward, one step back.Retirement at 63 offers a financial incentive to take early retirement - there is a financial upside of up to €40,000 for an average wage or salary earner, while higher earners reap even greater benefits.Retirement at 63 is something which favours age groups that are currently close to retirement and punishes younger generations. That reminds me of Groucho Marx, who once said: Why should I care about posterity? What's posterity ever done for me?.It's true that the increase in pension payments will not directly raise contribution rates on account of the high level of reserves. But from a medium-term perspective, it will drive up non-wage labour costs as well.Another outcome of retirement at 63 is that workers that are still needed in the labour market will cease to be available. According to our calculations, retirement at 63 will diminish the labour force potential by around 165,000 people by 2016.Germany does not have enough workers going forward. In 2020, the number of workers available to the labour market will probably have shrunk by 1½ million compared with today's figures. In 2020, this demographic effect will have depressed economic output by nearly €70 billion.If Germany is going to address this problem, it will need more and better qualified workers in the future. One way of dealing with this challenge is to develop a systematic policy for attracting qualified foreign labour with the skills needed in the German economy.Female participation in the labour force also needs to be boosted. Non-contributory inclusion in the statutory health insurance scheme, for instance, sets the wrong incentives here. Second, we need a policy aimed at raising employee productivity. Investment in pre-school education in particular promises to yield substantial rewards.Yet retirement at 63 is not the only initiative which poses a risk to the overall economy; the introduction of a statutory minimum wage - which was decided today by the Bundestag - is also problematic.Even if experiences in other countries do not support the view that a minimum wage directly increases unemployment, it might nonetheless place a strain on employment trends. There is a risk that enterprises will take on fewer new staff in periods of economic upturn.At the current juncture, 12 percent of workers in Germany earn less than €8.50 per hour; in eastern Germany that figure is as much as 17 percent. Many of them are low-skilled workers whose prospects in the labour market look set to deteriorate in the future.Ladies and gentlemenThe need for reform in the sluggish countries should not blind us to the fact that there is a need for economic policy action here in Germany, too. A few months ago the Wall Street Journal ran a story entitled Euro Zone's Next Reform Candidate: Germany.A saying we know from the world of sport is equally pertinent in other walks of life: don't rest on your laurels. We have seen that there is truth in this saying at the World Cup in Brazil, where some of the favourites have already come in for quite a nasty surprise.Unlike the World Cup, the euro area is not a knockout competition that can only be won by one team; it is about winning as a team and achieving success for everyone involved. But one thing that football and monetary union do have in common is that they both need a clear set of sensible rules.Football is such a popular sport because its rules are relatively easy to understand. On the whole, the basic rules have not changed much, although the finer details have been refined from time to time. For instance, the current World Cup is the first to use goal-line technology. The euro area, too, has a set of rules, an institutional framework. This framework needs to be reformed in order to make monetary union more crisis-resistant. It is not sufficiently stable as it stands.While it is true that fiscal stabilisation programmes and effective assistance on the part of the Eurosystem have succeeded in preventing the crisis from flaring up, it was this very policy which brought about a precarious situation: liability for the crisis countries' debt has essentially been communitised while fiscal policy remains a matter for national policymakers. That doesn't augur well for the future.Liability is a core element of our economic system. That's something every entrepreneur knows - after all, doing business means picking up the tab if things go wrong.That's why I think the euro area has reached a kind of crossroads: either we proceed towards a fiscal union in the sense of establishing joint liability with centralised rights to intervene in fiscal matters at the European level, or we turn back to the original framework as specified in the Maastricht Treaty and reinforce the principle of individual national responsibility.Both paths can put liability and control back on an even keel and bring risks and opportunities into alignment. Which path is the right one to take is a matter for policymakers to decide.I believe that governments and the public at large are currently less than willing to take the step towards a bona fide fiscal union, seeing as this would mean ceding a great deal of national sovereignty in fiscal policy matters.Those calling for greater mutual liability are often the very ones who reject recommendations from Brussels as meddling in national matters. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, for instance, likens the EU to an old boring aunt telling us what to do.It was a long-held belief, above all in Germany, that monetary union would, out of necessity as it were, culminate in political union. Addressing the Bundestag in November 1991, Helmut Kohl remarked that the idea of sustaining economic and monetary union over time without political union is a fallacy.The Bundesbank likewise stressed at the time that political union was crucial if monetary union was to prove durable. Viewed with hindsight, I would qualify that statement somewhat to say that monetary union can also function without political union provided that the principle of individual national responsibility is adhered to.This view is supported by Udo Di Fabio, a former judge at the Federal Constitutional Court, who said that monetary union was only feasible if the prevailing principle of each member state bearing individual responsibility for its own fiscal policy was not undermined by collective liability.Ladies and gentlemenIn a monetary union, there are negative repercussions for all other member states if one country has excessive debt - even if they are responsible for their own budgets. A monetary union therefore requires fiscal guidelines.  That is why the decision, taken in connection with the euro rescue measures, to tighten fiscal rules in a bid to promote individual responsibility was a step in the right direction. Ultimately, however, applying the rules is what counts, or, to put it in the words of a footballer ahead of tomorrow's important World Cup match: It's what happens on the pitch that matters. You cannot put it more succinctly than Germany's football legend Adi Preissler.As regards the proper application of the rules, some doubts are justified, as is evident from the current debate surrounding a flexible interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact.The Pact, which was reformed less than three years ago, allows much scope for discretion. Moreover, there is a risk that last week's decisions of the European Council will provide even more of a pretext for a lax interpretation. However, an excessively generous interpretation of this leeway would certainly undermine the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact.And let us not forget: in the medium term, the Pact stipulates balanced or close to balance budgets. The 3 percent mark that is frequently used as a yardstick is therefore a ceiling and is not intended as a regular target. This is, incidentally, also true of the 60 percent debt ratio that almost all euro countries breach.The Commission should therefore apply a narrow interpretation to the rules, and the German government should lend it its decisive support. That, too, is part and parcel of being a role model.Nor is consolidation a growth brake, but rather a precondition for sustainable growth. More debt is no precondition for successful structural reform.Binding debt rules are a necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition for strengthening the principle of individual responsibility in a monetary union. To this end, the no bail-out principle would have to be more credible, amongst other things. Ultimately, that would mean allowing governments to become insolvent.That, in turn, requires robust banks: going forward, neither a sovereign default nor the insolvency of a major bank must threaten the stability of the financial system.Progress has doubtless been made on the road to a more resilient financial system: banks' capitalisation is better now than before the crisis, preparations for the Single Supervisory Mechanism are in full swing, and a Single Resolution Mechanism for banks has been agreed.Nonetheless, further regulatory measures are required to loosen the doom loop between sovereigns and banks. In future, banks should have to provide capital backing for loans to governments. And there should be ceilings for lending to governments, as there are for loans to the private sector.Moreover, rapid regulation of the shadow banking sector is needed to stop regulation of the banking sector from leading to financial business increasingly being moved to unregulated market segments.Bertolt Brecht said it all in the Threepenny Opera when he wrote:There are some who are in darkness,and the others are in the light, and you see the ones in brightness, those in darkness drop from sight.More light therefore needs to be shone into the financial system. And that is precisely the objective of many current regulatory initiatives. The Bundesbank and the German finance minister are pulling together to make them happen.A stable regulatory framework for the monetary union would also protect the Eurosystem from permanently acting as crisis manager.The Eurosystem's crisis measures have helped prevent the crisis from escalating. However, some of these measures have, as I have repeatedly pointed out, taken the Eurosystem to the outer edge of its mandate.Meanwhile, the comprehensive measures agreed by the Governing Council of the ECB at the beginning of June cannot, in my opinion, be compared with the crisis measures taken two or three years ago. The current measures do not provide for individual countries' liability risks to be taken onto the Eurosystem's balance sheet. The task now is to prevent too prolonged a period of low inflation. For that could paralyse the euro-area's economy.Savers are understandably angry at extremely low interest rates that are more than eaten up by inflation. However, interest rates on savings have been lower than the rate of inflation on numerous occasions, even during the D-Mark era.The June decision was preceded by much soul-searching as to how best to proceed. For these measures too are associated with risks and side-effects, which we would be wrong to play down.In the long term, the ultra-loose monetary policy poses risks to financial stability. There is a danger of exaggerations on the asset and real estate markets - just think of the search for yield. Life insurers are finding it difficult to generate guaranteed returns.I am also worried that the low interest rates will reduce the pressure on governments to tackle their countries' problems energetically. There is a danger that the low interest rates will be used not to consolidate budgets, but to finance additional spending.And so it is particularly important to make it quite clear now that the Eurosystem will not put off a necessary normalisation of monetary policy out of consideration for public finances. Looking at the euro area, I therefore say that monetary policy has done its bit towards maintaining price stability.We will observe very closely what impact the measures have, and it will be a while before they take full effect. I therefore believed it was wrong to speculate on further measures immediately after the decisions were taken. This is unnecessary and undermines the measures we have only just adopted.Allow me to return to the comparison with soap operas: unlike soaps, monetary policy does not need cliffhangers to tempt the viewer to tune into the next episode.Ladies and gentlemenWith Lithuania's accession to the euro area, the number of member states will swell to 19 next year. As a result, the rotation system, as it is known, will automatically come into force in the Governing Council of the ECB, which has met with some criticism in Germany.Allow me to say only this much:The best way of dispelling these concerns is to operate within the core area of our mandate and not to redistribute liability risks between the taxpayers of the individual countries on a large scale.Ladies and gentlemenErhardt once said: Pessimists are people who wear sunglasses when they look into the future.The comedian Heinz Erhardt, that is, not the politician Ludwig Erhard.I hope you will not consider me a pessimist when I say that the crisis in the euro area is not over yet. Much more needs to be done to overcome it permanently.The member states must adapt better to the requirements of a monetary union. The institutional framework of the monetary union, too, must be improved in order to make it less susceptible to crises. Liability and control must be aligned.Monetary policy must not allow itself to be misappropriated for fiscal policy purposes. In the long term, this would jeopardise the independence of the central bank. Yet the central bank's independence is a key precondition for keeping the value of the currency stable.

"2014-07-04 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","The Italian writer Edmondo de Amicis described Istanbul as a universal beauty where poet and archaeologist, diplomat and merchant, princess and sailor, northerner and westerner screams with the same admiration. As far as I am concerned, he could have added central bankers to the list of those who admire the city of Istanbul.Which is to say I am happy to be here today at the joint seminar of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and the Deutsche Bundesbank. I would like to thank our Turkish colleagues for their hospitality, and to express my gratitude to all who helped make this seminar possible.Turkey and Germany are closely connected. At the beginning of the 1960s, the first Turkish immigrants came to Germany, and today, more than 50 years later, around 3 million people of Turkish origin live within Germany's borders. Our two countries are therefore connected not only at the political but also at a very personal level.Last year, the central banks of Turkey and Germany added a new level of partnership. Since November, a representative of the Bundesbank has been based in Istanbul to build networks, to share information and ideas, to explain the Bundesbank's positions and to facilitate cooperation. This joint seminar on financial stability is the tangible outcome of these efforts.Today's and tomorrow's seminar covers an issue in which international cooperation is certainly necessary: financial stability is a public good, and a global one at that. The past few years have taught us that financial crises do not stop at national borders. We live in an integrated world, and no country is able to insulate itself any more.That said, we need a global approach to secure financial stability, and the fundamentals of such an approach are personal contacts, open exchange and mutual understanding. For me, one of the main objectives of this seminar is to strengthen these fundamentals.Central banks in particular have a natural interest in financial stability, and in many instances they are involved in safeguarding it. Nevertheless, it is important to make a distinction between the different roles that central banks have to play. The primary goal of monetary policy is to safeguard price stability. To reach this objective, the independence of monetary policy has to be maintained in all its dimensions, at all times and everywhere. Thus, to safeguard financial stability, a different set of tools is necessary, and these tools are usually referred to as macroprudential policy.Having established that, let us take a brief look at current risks for financial stability. Not every country faces the same risks, of course. Turkey most certainly faces different challenges than Germany. Nevertheless, there is an underlying trend at the global level that influences financial stability in most countries.This trend has four elements: very low inflation and very low interest rates in major economies as well as abundant liquidity and low volatility in many financial markets. Together, these four ingredients make up a cocktail that may well result in a bad headache the morning after.One potential problem is the search for yield. Investors may eventually increase the risk of their investments to make up for the shortfall in yields caused by low interest rates. And, indeed, it seems that investors have already begun their search for yield.In its latest annual report the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) states that, Some asset valuations showed signs of decoupling from fundamentals. One example can be found in corporate debt markets. Here, valuations indeed look somewhat stretched. The BIS estimates that gross issuance in the high-yield bond market increased to US$90 billion per quarter in 2013 - three times the pre-crisis quarterly average of US$30 billion.The strong recovery in the property markets of some euro-area countries should also set us thinking. Take the German housing market, for example. Between 2009 and 2012, prices in large cities rose by almost 25 percent. In 2013, they increased by another 8.9 percent, and Bundesbank calculations point to overvaluations in urban areas. Nevertheless, overall, prices in Germany have not yet moved away from fundamentals. Thus, at this point in time, we see some local exuberance but not a bubble.But it is not only bond markets and housing markets we have to keep our eye on. Stock markets are an important issue as well. In 2013, there was only one way for most stock markets to go, and that was up. The EuroStoxx 50 increased by 18 percent, the FTSE 100 by 14 percent, the Dow Jones by 28 percent, and the Nikkei skyrocketed by as much as 57 percent. The BIS notes that, As the search for yield expanded to equity markets, the link between fundamentals and prices weakened amid historically subdued volatility and low risk premia.Market volatility indeed decreased, and reached historically low levels. However, as soon as monetary policy normalises, volatility is likely to increase. This is not reflected in today's volatility levels and might tempt market participants to neglect the necessity of hedging against changes in interest rates. Let me make it clear: low volatility does not stand for low risks, and interest rates will rise again at some point.So, have financial markets entered a new phase of irrational exuberance? The Bank for International Settlement finds it hard to avoid the sense of a puzzling disconnect between the markets' buoyancy and underlying economic developments globally. At the very least, it seems that financial markets are anticipating significant further improvements in economic fundamentals and prospects. And they are anticipating that governments around the world will continue to implement the necessary reforms. These expectations create vast scope for confidence shocks.This, in turn, interacts in an unfavourable way with another risk arising from a prolonged period of low interest rates. A prolonged period of low interest rates could set the wrong incentives: it could encourage banks to postpone necessary balance sheet adjustments, and it could encourage governments to postpone necessary structural reforms and the consolidation of public finances.We must not let ourselves be deceived by the current tranquillity in financial markets. The biggest threats to financial stability are complacency and reform fatigue. It is in the hands of governments around the world to eliminate this threat by keeping to the course of reform.I am now looking forward to discussing these and other issues during this seminar.",2014-07-04,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-07-04,"Istanbul","Turkey","Joint Seminar of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and the Deutsche Bundesbank","Deceptive tranquility and the threat of reform fatigue",1054,17.8,5,42.2,11.7,"EN"
"2014-07-05 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","As I pointed out in my opening remarks yesterday, I am happy to be here in Istanbul to attend this joint seminar of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and the Deutsche Bundesbank. Over the past two days we have shared ideas about macroprudential policy, and we have improved these ideas through discussion.At this point, I wish to change the perspective and take a closer look at the real economy and the macroeconomic situation in Germany. And as Germany is part of a monetary union, my presentation would be incomplete without discussing the situation of the euro area as well.Looking to the past, the German economy has shown a remarkable development. As late as 2004, the Economist magazine dubbed Germany the sick man of Europe. Plagued by high unemployment and a lack of competitiveness, Germany undertook structural reforms that were as painful as they were successful. Germany left the sick-bed and took bold steps towards recovery - only to be hit full-force by the fall-out of the financial crisis.In 2009, amidst a global recession, German GDP dropped by 5.1 percent. For Germany this was by far the biggest downturn in post-war history. However, the economy recovered quickly and in 2011, German GDP had returned to its pre-crisis level - sooner than in any other country in the euro area.What is the story behind this V-shaped recovery, the big drop and the quick rebound? From a general point of view, it was the structural reforms I mentioned before that prepared the ground for the strong recovery following the crisis.Nevertheless, the distinctive pattern of a severe drop and a rapid recovery highlights a specific feature of the German economy: its pronounced export orientation. When the global economy faltered in 2009, Germany was hit far worse than other countries. But when the global economy began to recover in 2010, Germany followed suit. Exports were the major driving force behind the upturn in the German economy.This strong influence of international trade worried some observers. Many felt that Germany’s reliance on exports was risky, as it exposed Germany to the ups and downs of the global economy. Thus, suggestions have been voiced to adapt the German business model and reduce reliance on exports. However, these arguments neglect the fact that Germany is not a company with a business model that management can change at will. In the end, it is the decisions of thousands of individual companies that determine the structure of an economy.In any case, I have doubts that turning away from global markets would strengthen the German economy. Facing global competition ensures that German companies keep up with technological progress and retain their high productivity. This might come at the price of higher volatility, but to me this seems like a price worth paying.Having said that, the German economy would certainly profit from strengthening competition in the domestic market as well. Take the services sector as an example. For the last 20 years, total factor productivity growth in services has been markedly lower than in manufacturing. In fact, while total factor productivity in manufacturing has grown by more than 30 percent, growth in services has barely budged.What is behind this phenomenon? The data point to a higher degree of competition in the manufacturing sector following the launch of the Common Market: mark-ups, an indicator of the pricing power of firms, have gone down since then. By contrast, mark-ups on services have stayed high in Germany, higher even than in many other European countries.Thus, there is room to improve the functioning of the services sector by promoting competition: opening up closed professions, cutting red tape, and improving financing conditions for nascent digital firms would be options to achieve this objective.But still, over the last two years or so, domestic drivers of growth have strengthened in Germany. This is certainly good news, as the basis for growth has become broader.The good shape of the German economy is also reflected in more recent developments. Last year, the economy regained momentum after a brief dip in late 2012 and early 2013. And in the first quarter of this year, the economy grew by 0.8 percent, while the euro area as a whole grew by 0.2 percent. However, the strong growth in the first quarter was boosted by favourable weather conditions. Consequently, we expect growth to be weaker in the second quarter. Overall, the German economy is back within the normal range of capacity utilisation.Against this backdrop, what can we expect from the future? Well, the internal drivers of growth I mentioned will remain in place while foreign demand is likely to pick up again. As a result, growth will be even more broadly based, and its pace is likely to increase further over the next two years. The Bundesbank expects growth to be 1.7 percent this year, and to accelerate to 2.0 percent in 2015.Yet despite this relatively favourable economic position, there is absolutely no room for complacency. The German economy certainly faces significant challenges. Demographic trends, for instance, will pose a sizable challenge to Germany sooner rather than later. The German potential labour force will start to decline from 2018 onwards. Germany therefore needs to act now.One path would be to increase labour force participation. And there are indeed labour force reserves, particularly among women and the elderly. Germany needs to go to great lengths to integrate them more closely into the economic process. But there is an additional option to address demographic challenges: immigration. A systematic approach to attract skilled labour from abroad would help cushion the impact of an ageing society on the labour market.In any case, Germany has to accept that fewer workers might be at its disposal in the future. Thus, it will be all the more important for those workers to be trained as well as possible. This will require an education system that meets high standards which are comparable across Germany. Such a system will give children, youth and young adults the necessary environment and assistance to develop their talents to the fullest.And there is another aspect of demography one has to consider. The demographic burdens on Germany’s public budgets will soon grow sharply. Reducing the debt ratio is therefore a matter of urgency in order to combat this. After all, to quote a German politician, New debt is tantamount to issuing bills of exchange which my grandchildren will pay off. However, many still tend to agree more with Groucho Marx, who is reputed to have asked himself, Why should I care about posterity? What has posterity ever done for me? This is probably not the best approach.To conclude: there are challenges ahead, but the German economy is in good shape and the outlook is quite favourable. I think it is justified to attribute this to the structural reforms undertaken more than a decade ago. Does this make Germany a role model for other countries in the euro area? Certainly not down to every detail. Each country is different, and each country needs a different set of reforms. There is one thing we can learn from Germany’s experience, though: reforms do pay off eventually. This is an important point to remember and it is confirmed by the current state of the euro area. Let us take a closer look.In the euro area, the end of the crisis is getting closer - slowly but steadily. Most importantly, the euro area as a whole has finally emerged from recession. So far, we have seen four consecutive quarters of positive growth, and looking ahead, we expect growth to continue. Latest projections by the ECB suggest that euro-area GDP will grow by 1.0 percent in 2014 and by 1.7 percent in 2015.And this recovery is not only driven by the core euro-area countries such as Germany. Some of the crisis-hit countries have also finally embarked on the path to recovery. It seems, then, that the efforts to implement structural reforms are indeed bearing fruit.Competitiveness has improved in most peripheral countries. Improving competitiveness in turn drives exports higher. All peripheral countries, except Cyprus, are projected to see some export growth this year. These achievements are reflected in current accounts increasingly reverting to positive balances.And Germany is part of this rebalancing equation. Since 2007, Germany’s current account surplus vis-à-vis the euro area has shrunk continuously from 4½ percent of GDP to 2 percent of GDP. As business investment in Germany is projected to pick up in 2014 and 2015, this rebalancing should continue.The progress that these abstract figures reflect is also visible in more concrete events. For example, Ireland, Spain and Portugal have exited their financial support programmes without any friction. All three countries recently returned to the sovereign bond markets at relatively low yields.At the same time, stock markets in these economies have been rising for some time now. These developments underscore the progress that some peripheral euro-area countries have made in adjusting their economies.However, despite these favourable developments, there is again no time for complacency. In many countries structural reforms are far from finalised, as a report by the EU Parliament suggests. At the same time, public debt is still very high in many countries and has to come down.Against this backdrop, the recent debate about loosening the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact worries me. It seems that the experience from the crisis is already fading from collective memory. Given the deceptive tranquillity in the financial markets, we are at risk of forgetting what the crisis has taught us about public finances.But that would have dire consequences. As I emphasised in my opening remarks yesterday, the markets do anticipate that reforms will be finalised and that public budgets will be consolidated. Thus, any doubts over the sustainability of public finances can send huge shockwaves across the euro area. In addition, mountains of private and public debt block the way towards sustainable economic growth. And on a side note: at this stage of integration in the euro area, euro-bonds would not be the right path to choose as they would weaken the incentives for prudent fiscal policy.Nevertheless, to me, the recent debate about the Stability and Growth Pact shows something else. It seems that there is an expectation that, in the end, monetary policy will provide the ultimate backstop. This expectation, however, is dangerous and cannot be the guideline for policy action - or rather inaction.Monetary policy certainly helped prevent the crisis from escalating. Still, there is one thing we should be clear about: monetary policy cannot solve the underlying causes of the crisis. It can only buy time. And it is up to national governments to use that time to dig out the root causes of the crisis. Failing to do so will push us back into dangerous territory. We must not let that happen.Ladies and gentlemenI have presented what I consider to be good news. The German economy is gaining in strength and the euro area has embarked on the path to recovery. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind, what the Irish horse racing jockey Tony McCoy said: there is no place for arrogance or complacency in racing because you are up there one minute and on your backside the next. Keeping up economically is certainly a race and we should avoid the risk of landing on our backside. Thus, my warning: beware complacency.As a final point, let me emphasise that I have very much enjoyed attending this seminar. It has certainly helped strengthen the ties between the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and the Deutsche Bundesbank.

"2014-07-09 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Welcome to the Bundesbank’s 18th banking symposium. I’m delighted to see that we have a full house again and that our programme has attracted participants from all across Germany. I would also like to welcome my colleagues on the Bundesbank’s Executive Board: Mr Böhmler, Mr Nagel and Mr Thiele. Deputy President Buch and President Weidmann would like to have joined us here today, but have prior engagements; they pass on their best wishes. As you can tell, the Executive Board members are of one mind when it comes to banking supervision.This symposium is something of a debut for me, as it’s the first time that I’ve participated in this event in my new role as the Executive Board member responsible for banking supervision. And this comes in a crucial year for banking supervision. Before I go any further, I would like to give a special mention to my colleague on the Executive Board, Joachim Nagel. As you may well know, Mr Nagel stood in as the board member responsible for banking supervision for several months after our Deputy President, Ms Lautenschläger, left to join the ECB in January. Mr Nagel, we would all like to thank you very much for the extremely valuable work you have done in the sphere of banking supervision.As you may know, I myself worked at commercial banks for many years before taking up office at the Bundesbank in 2010, which means that I have experienced supervision from both sides of the fence. And I know that all of us - supervisors and supervised alike - have the same goal: a stable banking system for a strong economy. Yet we can only succeed if we work together. So I propose that we use this event as an opportunity to share our views and experiences.Dialogue is vital to banking supervision. That is always true, but never more so than in periods of major upheaval. And I'm sure you'll all agree that we are currently experiencing precisely such a phase. So I'm especially pleased that Danièle Nouy, the Chair of the Supervisory Board of the new Single Supervisory Mechanism, will be sharing her thoughts with us today. But first, I’d like to give you my perspective on the situation. My speech will centre around two key questions: “what is ‘good regulation’?” and “what is ‘good supervision’?”Banks and savings institutions play a vital role in any modern economy and, indeed, in our everyday lives. We simply could not manage without them. Entrepreneurs, bankers and individuals alike: we all benefit from a stable banking and financial system. Financial stability is therefore a public good, not just nationally but on a global scale too. At the same time, banking can sometimes be associated with external effects. It doesn't just affect banks and their business associates; it also has an impact on third parties with no stake in the game. And during the financial crisis, those third parties were the taxpayers.Regulators and supervisors can rectify a market failure of this kind, and it is in the public interest for them to do just that. It isn't a question of whether but of how to regulate. And it is this matter of how to regulate that I would like to discuss now - not by focusing on specific legal provisions, but by outlining certain principles which I consider particularly important.To clear up any misunderstandings right from the outset, I would like to emphasise that it isn’t the job of regulators and supervisors to keep each and every bank in business. In a market economy, it has to be possible for banks without a workable business model to fail - however large, interconnected or significant they may be. The task of regulators is to create a framework in which market forces can take effect without destabilising the entire financial system.Yet it is vital to ensure that this framework is not overly rigid; we should not confuse stagnation with stability. The financial system is in constant flux, and regulation has to keep pace with it. Tradable asset backed securities are a case in point. Introducing timely and adequate regulation on this innovation might have prevented the financial crisis from taking such a dramatic course. The regulatory framework therefore needs to be just as adaptable as the financial system itself.It is now widely accepted that innovations rarely make the financial system simpler and usually make it more complex. The key financial innovation in the ancient Phoenician civilisation was the forward transaction - a financial instrument that you will all be familiar with today. Since then, financial innovations have become increasingly complex - to the point where the instruments used today are often understood by only a handful of experts.But does that mean that we need increasingly complex regulation too? Or could it be that we need only a few simple rules to ensure effective supervision and safeguard financial stability?One current example of this debate concerning simple and complex regulation is the leverage ratio. The advocates of a simple leverage ratio for banks want to replace the current risk-based capital rules with a “blanket” capital requirement. They believe that the same percentage of capital should be held against all assets, regardless of their risk. I have to admit that the idea appears appealingly simple at first sight. And it would avoid the mistakes and manipulation that can arise during the complex process of calculating risk weights.Yet a leverage ratio would also create the wrong incentives. If banks had to hold the same percentage of capital against all assets, any institution wanting to maximise its profits would probably invest in high-risk assets, as they produce particularly high returns. This would eradicate the corrective influence of capital cover in reducing risk.Weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of simple and complex regulation, it is probably better in this instance to use risk weightings in combination with the leverage ratio - which is precisely what the new rules envisage. Consequently, my answer to the first question is that regulation must be as simple as possible and as complex as necessary.Yet sometimes a certain set of circumstances can make regulation needlessly complex. One example of this is the leverage ratio. The calculation of this ratio, which is essentially quite simple, is complicated by the fact that accounting standards vary from country to country. Intricate conversion calculations are needed to make leverage ratios based on US accounting principles comparable to those based on the standards used in Europe. If accounting standards were harmonised at a global level, the applicable regulation would be simpler.However, the more complex the regulation, the more important it is to adhere to another principle: coherence. I believe that regulation must be coherent on at least three levels.First, regulation has to be coherent across borders and regions. We have a global financial system, and it therefore requires global regulation. Where regulation varies from country to country, there is a danger of regulatory arbitrage - of banks moving their business to countries with the lightest-touch regulation. The problem with this behaviour is that the risks stemming from these transactions could potentially affect the entire financial system. This is why the G20 have made the issue of financial market regulation a priority. In cooperation with the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, they are working to develop a coherent regulatory framework at the global level. Even so, I’m concerned to see that some countries outside Europe are adopting their own regulatory initiatives which breach the principle of cross-border coherence. I believe that the danger of banking regulation one day returning to the principle of every man for himself needs to be taken seriously.Yet regulation not only needs to be coherent across borders and regions but also across different sectors. Here, too, the central issue is the danger of regulatory arbitrage. One current example is the growth of the shadow banking industry, where financial enterprises conduct business which creates bank-like risks but is either regulated insufficiently or not at all. In many cases, these risks are not even recorded. Yet the shadow banking industry may become a source of systemic risk. We therefore need to expand the regulatory framework in this area to ensure that it is coherent.Third, it goes without saying that the content of regulation also needs to be coherent. The capital rules are a case in point. Unlike for all other forms of credit, banks do not have to hold capital against government bonds in line with the risks that they carry, and this inconsistency has dangerous side-effects. Since the euro-area sovereign debt crisis - if not before - it has become clear that government bonds are anything but risk-free. In this area too, we should work to restore the coherence of regulation in the medium term.As crucial as coherence is, however, regulation also has to be guided by the principle of proportionality. It is appropriate to apply strict regulation to large institutions which are closely interconnected within the financial system: the entities we call “systemically important institutions”. Equally, however, we must take care not to overburden small and medium-sized institutions; they should be governed by simpler regulation. The standardised approaches applied in supervision and de minimis thresholds such as those used in reporting can help us to achieve this proportionality.Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve outlined four different principles for ensuring good regulation. First, regulation has to be flexible and able to keep pace with developments in the financial system. Second, regulation must be as simple as possible and as complex as necessary. Third, regulation has to be coherent in terms of its content, as well as across borders, regions and sectors. Fourth, regulation must be guided by the principle of proportionality.Abiding by these principles will not, of course, allow us to solve every single regulatory problem. Yet they do provide us with a yardstick for assessing regulatory provisions. And I do believe that is very valuable.All in all, though, even the best regulation is useless if nobody is overseeing compliance. And that is precisely the job of supervisors. Supervisors have to make sure that, in the banks’ search for profit, they follow the rules and do not lose sight of the public interest.Do supervisors have to be the “better bankers”? No, absolutely not. Business decisions must be left to those being paid to make them. However, supervisors have to know - and understand - how banking works. Against this background, I personally would very much welcome an increase in the migration of staff between the banking industry and the supervisory agencies. I therefore consider it a good sign that a large number of bankers have been applying to join the ECB’s new European supervisory mechanism. And at the Bundesbank we are also noting a rise in the number of bankers showing an interest in and applying for vacancies in our banking supervision units.It is also important for supervisors to always remain aware of their true objective: to uphold the public interest. They must not allow themselves to succumb to a sort of “Stockholm Syndrome for supervisors” and confuse the public good with that of the supervised banks.This is an area where the new European supervisory mechanism can make a key contribution. By adding a European perspective to the national view, it will put more distance between the supervisor and the supervised entity. This will minimise the danger of supervisors getting all-too-close to their banks and thus treating them with “kid gloves” out of national interest.All in all, European-level supervision is the most important step towards financial market integration in the euro area since the launch of our single currency. It is a logical step, too, since a single monetary policy also requires integrated financial markets - which includes, without doubt, European-level supervision.An in-depth examination of all banks which will later be supervised directly by the ECB is now underway. The objective of this comprehensive assessment is to ensure that the new European supervisory authority has a smooth launch. We therefore view all measures that will strengthen the capital of German banks very positively. Over the past few months, many banks have begun to move in the right direction.Clear communication is essential to both the asset quality review and the stress test. I believe that the process should be as transparent as possible and the banks should be involved at the earliest possible stage as far as the law allows.Transparency will be especially important in the join-up of the results of the stress test and the asset quality review. In my view, we should work from the bottom up wherever possible - in other words, on the basis of specific data provided by the banks. Generalised assumptions should be used as little as possible.The creation of the new Single Supervisory Mechanism, or SSM, based at the ECB is surely the single greatest challenge we are currently facing. I am therefore particularly pleased that Danièle Nouy will be giving us a first-hand progress report today. The Bundesbank, for its part, is doing all it can to assist in the creation of the SSM.At this juncture, some of you might be asking whether German supervisors are digging their own grave. Once supervision is transferred to the European level, where will that leave the Bundesbank and BaFin? There are three points I would like to make on that subject.First, we Germans, of all people, should not succumb to the illusion that European-level supervision spells the end of national supervision. After all, from 4 November of this year, out of around 2,000 German credit institutions, only 21 will actually be supervised directly by the ECB. Our BaFin and Bundesbank supervisors will remain responsible for all other German institutions.Second, institutions under the ECB’s supervisory responsibility will be supervised by “joint supervisory teams” in the future, to which the Bundesbank and BaFin staff members will contribute their expertise. In addition, they will support supervision in other countries. Put simply, we're ceding, in whole or in part, responsibility for supervising 21 German institutions, but becoming involved in the supervision of 99 foreign institutions.The Bundesbank’s role in this area will build on our expertise and experience, as well as our nationwide presence. Over many years, we have built a close working relationship with you, ladies and gentlemen.The separation between supervisors and decision-makers has proved to be an efficient system. That is precisely why we should make similar arrangements for the new European supervisory mechanism, with the Bundesbank performing ongoing supervision, and the ECB taking the decisions.It just so happens that, at the same time as we are holding this forum, Germany’s Federal Cabinet is discussing amendments to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) today. The cabinet will consider whether changing this division of tasks and interrupting the direct reporting channel from the Bundesbank to the ECB constitutes “good regulation”. I doubt it. I believe that the Bundesbank has to be on an equal footing with the other supervisors. That is the only way to ensure effective European-level supervision.Ladies and gentlemen, the French writer François Fénelon once claimed that, “the more you say, the less people remember”. As this obviously isn’t my aim, I would like to conclude my remarks by taking a peek into the future.The past history of regulation has been one of constant ups and downs. Periods of deregulation have usually been followed by a crisis, then followed by a period of re-regulation, and again by a period of deregulation. It is precisely in phases of re-regulation that banks tend to complain about the time and money it costs - and the present period is no exception. But are we really overregulating? If we look at the benefits to society of a stable banking system and the social costs of a banking crisis, I believe the costs of regulation are justifiable.However, for the future I would like regulation to evolve somewhat more steadily and adapt more quickly to new challenges: the low-interest-rate phase, high-frequency trading, charges of manipulating the LIBOR or the setting of forex rates and gold prices, to name just a few examples. We should not wait until the aftermath of the next crisis to come up with ways of responding to these challenges.I do not believe, however, that regulators and supervisors are all-knowing and all-powerful. As I noted at the beginning of this speech, we can only maintain financial stability if we work together. You, the bankers, are just as responsible as us, the supervisors and regulators. I am well aware that the number of “bad apples” is very small. However, their behaviour causes all of us to suffer: the public, when a crisis breaks out, and the bankers, when the public tar them all with the same brush.Yet we should be aware that the value of the financial system is measurable against one key criterion: your reliability, ladies and gentlemen, as a service provider to the real economy. So let’s use this understanding to work together to make the financial system more stable - the ECB, BaFin, the Bundesbank and the banks. This symposium is a magnificent opportunity to exchange views and develop ideas.

"2014-07-15 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","For me, one of the central lessons from the financial crisis is this: the financial system is global in scope, and it therefore requires global regulation. To push this idea further, I would define the term “global” in at least three dimensions and argue that regulation should be consistent in all of them.First, regulation needs to be consistent across borders and regions. Where regulation varies from country to country, there is a danger of regulatory arbitrage - of banks moving their business to countries with the lightest-touch regulation. The problem with this behaviour is that the risks that are transferred could potentially affect the entire financial system.This is why the G20 have made the issue of financial market regulation a priority. In cooperation with the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, they are working to develop a consistent regulatory framework at the global level.Even so, I’m concerned to see that some countries outside Europe are adopting their own regulatory initiatives which breach the principle of cross-border consistency. I believe that the danger of banking regulation one day returning to the principle of every man for himself needs to be taken seriously. We must not let this happen.Second, regulation not only needs to be consistent across borders and regions but also across different sectors. Here, too, the central issue is the danger of regulatory arbitrage. One current example is the growth of the shadow banking industry, where financial enterprises conduct business which creates bank-like risks but is either regulated insufficiently or not at all.With banking regulation being tightened, banks have even more incentives to move their business to the shadow banking system. Thus, the shadow banking industry may become a source of systemic risk. We therefore need to expand the regulatory framework in this area to ensure that it is consistent.Third, regulation needs to be consistent across asset classes. Take the regulatory treatment of government bonds as an example. Unlike for all other forms of credit, banks do not have to hold capital against government bonds in line with the risks that they carry, and this inconsistency has dangerous side-effects.Since the euro-area sovereign debt crisis - if not before - it has become clear that government bonds are anything but risk-free. Thus, I cannot see a single good reason why banks should not have to back government bonds in their balance sheets by capital, but I see many reasons why they should. In this area too, we should work to restore the coherence of regulation in the medium term - not least to address the sovereign-bank nexus.To sum up: Financial regulation needs to be consistent across borders, across sectors and across asset classes. Ensuring these three dimensions of consistency will help to make the financial system a safer place.However, while being a safer place in the aggregate, the financial system is not necessarily a safe place for individual banks. After all, we live in a market economy and creative destruction is a central element. Individual banks must be able to fail like any other enterprise.This must also hold for large banks which are often labelled “too big to fail”. To allow them to fail without destabilising the entire system we need resolution mechanisms. And here again, we have a global dimension. Banks that are deemed too big to fail are globally operating enterprises; resolving them requires a great deal of international cooperation.Consequently, the Financial Stability Board has developed a set of principles for the resolution of systemically important institutions. These principles are the basis for resolution mechanisms around the world, including the Single Resolution Mechanism in the euro area.Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is obvious that to make the financial system a safer place we have to cooperate in regulation, in supervision, and in the resolution of banks. Globalisation and the experience from the recent crisis have made international cooperation a central principle of economic policy.",2014-07-15,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-07-15,"Tokio","Japan","Canon Institute for Global Studies and the EHESS","Financial regulation as a global challenge",658,18.8,5.1,41.4,12,"EN"
"2014-07-18 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","Thank you for your invitation and for giving me the opportunity to speak here today.A few months ago, a Spanish newspaper wrote about my institution: El Bundesbank, banco central alemán, baluarte del pensamiente neoliberal más dogmatico de la Unión Europea ….While my understanding of the Spanish language is poor - as is my pronunciation - I assume this was not meant as a compliment, and, moreover, it is not even truthful.That's why I am all the more delighted about the warm welcome you gave me here today.I would particularly like to thank Juergen Bernardo Donges for his kind introduction. Juergen and I worked closely together between 1999 and 2002 when the two of us were with the German Council of Economic Advisors - he was one of what are called the five wise men and I was their secretary-general.At that time, I remember, Germany was considered to be the sick man of Europe. The Economist magazine wrote in 1999: ... the biggest economic problem for Europe today is how to revive the German economy.Nowadays, Germany is called the economic powerhouse of Europe. This is not least the result of economic reforms that were implemented between 2003 and 2007. Moderate wage policies, greater flexibility in pay policy conditions and shrewd entrepreneurial decisions also helped to restore Germany's competitiveness.Germany's economic success means that it is often seen as a role model for other euro-area countries that have run in trouble. However, reforms in one country cannot be used as a blueprint elsewhere. Each country has to tackle its own structural problems, and it is up to governments, parliaments and their advisors to assess what can be learned from other countries' experiences.As far as Germany is concerned, there is no room for complacency; Germany has economic challenges of its own to face. Four of the most important are a rapidly diminishing labour force caused by demographic trends; increasing competition on account of globalisation, which is particularly relevant for an economy that succeeds in high technology rather than in the most advanced technology; changes in the energy markets and the politically favoured energy mix; and high levels of public debt.Looking at the German government's recent economic policy decisions, not all of them adequately address the needs resulting from these challenges nor do they set the kind of example which a large euro-area country like Germany should be setting for the other member states.However, I do not want to talk about Germany in too much detail today. Rather, I would like to share my views on the future of European monetary union.From an economist's point of view, the question whether a country should abandon its currency and join a monetary union is typically analysed in the framework of what is known as the theory of optimum currency areas.Without a doubt, the euro area lacks some of the characteristics of an optimal currency area. Labour mobility, for instance, is much lower than in the US; plus the business cycles are not synchronised, nor is there any central fiscal stabiliser.At the end of the day, the decision to create European monetary union was a political one, not an economic one. Nonetheless, in the first 15½ years since the euro was launched, people have enjoyed a stable currency. The average euro-area inflation rate has been 2.0  percent, which is very close to the ECB Governing Council's definition of price stability (below, but close to, 2  percent).However, the crisis exposed shortcomings on a national level and the fragilities of the institutional framework of the monetary union. But I am positive that if we learn from the sovereign debt crisis, the European economy will be stronger than before the crisis and we will be able to maintain our monetary union as a stability union - and it is indeed worth being maintained.In the next 30 or 40 minutes, I would like to discuss how we can achieve this end. I will start by looking into what still needs to be done at the national level. From there, I will go on to address the weaknesses in EMU's institutional foundation. Moreover, I will touch upon current monetary policy issues.But before I talk about what needs to be done, let us take a step back and consider what went wrong in the first place.  For many euro-area member states, the introduction of the euro ushered in a new era of abundant capital owing to the elimination of exchange rate risks. However, the favourable financing conditions in the euro-area countries which had previously higher interest rates mainly stimulated investment in real estate and public and private consumption.Over time, unit labour costs soared, while competitiveness declined. Between 1999 and 2007, on average unit labour costs rose in Spain by 3.0  percent per year compared to a slight decline in Germany of -0.1  percent. This led to a decline in Spain's competitiveness of more than 15  percent over that period.When the financial crisis broke out in 2007, the vulnerabilities were laid bare: investor sentiment began to shift, and interest rates for the countries in question started to rise sharply, triggering a crisis that is still far from being fully resolved.In order to understand the onset of the crisis, it is useful to remind ourselves of the euro area's unique institutional set-up.The euro area teams up one common monetary policy with 18 national fiscal and economic policies. This approach reflects a currency area composed of sovereign member states. It grants member states sufficient leeway to preserve their diversity, that is, to establish their own business models or to tailor institutions and policies to their own national preferences.Such preferences can differ, for example, with respect to income redistribution or the role of the state in the economy. At the same time, it leaves the consequences of such decisions with the respective member state and consistently rules out the option of mutualising public debt with other euro-area states. But this set-up also creates vulnerabilities.First, a combination of this kind gives rise to a deficit bias, as it allows the costs of fiscal imprudence to be shifted partially on to others. An unsustainable fiscal situation in one country has repercussions for monetary union as a whole.You can compare this to what economists call the tragedy of the commons. Just as overfishing creates negative externalities for other countries, excessive public debt harms the euro area as a whole. Excessive debt in one member state drives up longer-term interest rates for all euro-area countries.And second, each member state issues debt in a currency it cannot create. Thus, a high level of fiscal discipline is needed to ensure that solvency concerns do not spiral out of control.Even if there are no explicit fiscal transfers, and irrespective of the approval of national legislatures, central banks' balance sheets can nonetheless serve as a conduit for shifting risks among national taxpayers if those central banks agree to finance national debt.This shift is undermining both countries' individual national responsibility and central banks' independence. If central bank independence is used for purposes other than price stability, it is only a question of time before central bank independence itself is challenged.The founding fathers of the euro clearly foresaw the risk of unsustainable public finances for a stability-oriented monetary policy. That was why precautions were put in place to safeguard sound public finances and to protect monetary policy. They took the form of a prohibition of monetary financing of government deficits, the no bail-out clause and the Stability and Growth Pact.Barry Eichengreen and Charles Wyplosz wrote in an article in 1998: The most compelling rationale for the Stability Pact rests on the need to buttress the no-bailout rule of the Maastricht Treaty. And, sensing what might happen, the two economists continued: That need will be most pressing where debt problems place banking systems at risk and where bond market contagion is pervasive.At the time, it was assumed that by constraining governments' ability to fiscally stimulate demand - and by shifting monetary policy to the European level - governments would have no choice but to implement structural reforms, improve their supply side, and strengthen their potential for sustainable growth.It was also thought that the financial markets would enforce fiscal discipline. As it turned out, things did not exactly work out as expected.The fiscal rules were breached numerous times, not least by Germany and France. In addition, investors made hardly any distinction between the bonds of individual member states.From 1999 to 2007 the average difference between EMU government bonds, excluding Germany, and German government bonds, for instance, was a mere 14 basis points which compares to an average spread of 190 basis points over the last five years.I will leave it for you to decide whether this was because investors turned a blind eye to the growing differences in economic fundamentals or because they never really bought the idea that the no bail-out clause would hold when the going got tough.The title of the sick man of Europe often changes hands. Countries other than Germany are currently the reigning champions in this discipline.But many countries have made substantial efforts to cut their public deficits. Additionally, structural reforms aimed at removing rigidities in product and labour markets are now underway.A number of labour market reforms have been introduced to foster employment and reduce adjustment costs during economic downswings. According to the OECD indicators for labour market rigidity, the stressed countries have made noticeable progress in this area. In addition, the retirement age has been raised as well.Product market rigidities that weaken competition, produce regulatory red tape and inhibit growth are also being addressed. And according to the World Bank's Doing Business Report, progress has been made in this regard as well: Portugal, Italy, and Spain have climbed up the ranking ladder by 17, 13, and 10 positions respectively over the last four years. Greece has even moved up 37 positions.   Current accounts in the deficit countries have improved - not only because of shrinking imports, but also because of expanding exports. The latter has been supported by decreasing unit labour costs.Spain has markedly improved its price competitiveness through lower unit labour costs. Currently, unit labour costs are 6½ percent below their pre-crisis level, while they have risen by 10  percent in the euro area as a whole.In the stressed countries, factors of production are being reallocated to sectors with a strong focus on exports. The construction sector in Ireland accounted for over half of the decrease in aggregate employment; in Spain, Italy and Portugal, it accounted for around two-fifths. In industry, by contrast, either far fewer jobs have been cut or - as in Ireland - new jobs have recently been created.Thanks to improved competitiveness, Spanish exports have risen by 8  percent over the past 12 months. Since the cyclical trough in 2009, exports have even risen by more than 50  percent, with intermediate goods showing particularly strong growth.Overall, thanks to the reform efforts made so far, the underlying conditions in most of the periphery countries are already significantly better than they were before the crisis. Progress has been uneven, though, and further reforms are needed. To address the problem of very high unemployment, the IMF recommends more decentralised wage setting and the introduction of greater flexibility at the firm level to adapt wages, working hours and employment to the economic situation, which might also be a way forward for Spain.Overcoming the crisis is still an uphill struggle; if you don't go forwards, you go backwards. With regard to reforms, governments therefore have to keep the pedal to the metal.However, is it a German central banker's task to call for structural reforms and budget consolidation in other euro-area countries?Given the important role that sustainable public finances and highly productive member states play in buttressing a stability-oriented monetary policy, and given that the Eurosystem has bought time for national action, I don't think that bringing to mind the pledges that were made to embrace consolidation and structural reforms constitutes meddling in national affairs.In the euro area, we share a common currency, which means that a lack of reform in one country has implications for the euro area as a whole and for the stability of our monetary union.While adjustment has to happen primarily in the deficit countries, countries running a current account surplus, such as Germany, face challenges as well, as I have outlined before. Last Sunday's victory in the football World Cup should not blind us to reality, either. As Gideon Rachman wrote in a Financial Times comment: Germany is undoubtedly going through a golden moment - on and off the football-field - but there are reasons for fearing that it will prove all too momentary.In any case, deliberately weakening the competitiveness of Germany's export sector would harm, rather than benefit, the stressed countries' economies. We should bear in mind that German exports contain imported intermediate inputs from other euro-area countries amounting to 9  percent of the overall added value. If Germany were to accept the economic advice to excessively boost its wages in order to stimulate domestic demand, it would harm employment in Germany and, as a consequence, the economic situation in the entire euro area as simulation results show.Despite this, it is clear that against the background of Germany's strong cyclical position and the tight labour market, wages will rise faster than in the rest of the euro area. We expect effective wages to rise more than 3  percent this year and next year.However, when it comes to taking action at the European level, the challenges facing monetary union are also considerable.The safeguards originally put in place for the stability of monetary union, the Stability and Growth Pact and the no bail-out clause, failed to prevent the crisis. As I have already pointed out, there are additional macroeconomic imbalances which likewise pose a threat to the stability of the euro area: a steady loss of competitiveness, persistent current account deficits and high levels of private debt.Measures to address these deficiencies, such as the strengthened Stability and Growth Pact, the Fiscal Compact and macroeconomic surveillance, have been implemented. I will come back to this in a minute.Ultimately, the risk of contagion between countries was also underestimated when monetary union was established. In response to the crisis, rescue mechanisms such as the EFSF and ESM were put in place, and they did manage to contain the fallout somewhat.But at the same time, the rescue mechanisms have weakened the principle of individual responsibility, as fiscal responsibility has essentially remained national, while liabilities have been partially mutualised. In other words: the balance between liability and control has become lopsided. Yet I believe that this balance is fundamental to the stability of Europe's monetary union.But how do we restore that balance, and put monetary union on a more solid footing? In principle, there are two ways: first, by creating a genuine fiscal union, or second, by making the principle of individual responsibility work.The first option, a genuine fiscal union, would require the member states to relinquish their fiscal sovereignty and cede it to the European level. In such a setting, the mutualisation of future liabilities would be consistent. This step would necessitate changes to the European treaties and amendments to national constitutions.In Germany, such a leap towards more political integration used to be seen as inevitable. Addressing the Bundestag in 1991, Helmut Kohl, for example, remarked that the idea of sustaining economic and monetary union over time without political union is a fallacy. But judging by the reluctance of governments and electorates to let Brussels have a say in fiscal matters, this avenue seems to be blocked, at least for the foreseeable future.This leaves us with the second option, making the principle of individual responsibility work better.Since public debt in one country has negative spillover effects on other countries in a monetary union, a set of fiscal rules is required, even if the principle of individual responsibility works. Thus, the stiffening of the Stability and Growth Pact and the Fiscal Compact were steps in the right direction. But the mere existence of these rules will not suffice.The question of how effective these changes will be can best be summed up by the proverb the proof of the pudding is in the eating which is often attributed to the Spanish novelist Cervantes because it is cited in a widespread English translation of Don Quixote. However, in the Spanish original you read y si no, al freír de los huevos lo verá, meaning something like you will see it when you fry the eggs.In other words, it is not yet clear whether the new rules do really bite. Strict and consistent application of the stiffened rules is therefore important. Here, the Commission has a special responsibility.Metaphorically speaking, we need to make sure that the Commission does not go beyond its role as a referee and move the goalposts mid-game. In this regard, some doubts are warranted, as is evident from the recent debate surrounding a flexible interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact, which was reformed less than three years ago, grants a great deal of discretionary scope.Moreover, there is a risk that recent decisions by the European Council will provide even more of a pretext for lax interpretation. However, an excessively generous interpretation of this leeway would certainly undermine the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact.It was only last week when Mario Draghi warned: To unwind the consolidation that has been achieved, and in doing so to divest the rules of credibility, would be self-defeating for all countries.And let us not forget: in the medium term, the Pact stipulates balanced or close to balance budgets. The 3  percent mark that is frequently used as a yardstick is therefore a ceiling and not intended to be a regular TARGET. This is, incidentally, also true of the 60  percent debt ratio that almost all euro countries breach.A look in the rear-view mirror shows how poorly the fiscal rules have worked as a speed limit. Since the introduction of the euro, the economically important member states of France and Italy have exceeded the upper public deficit limit of 3  percent of GDP in nine out of 15 years. Germany, meanwhile, has had seven entries in the class register. And as for 2014, we expect six out of 18 countries to exceed the limit.In the long run, consolidation does not inhibit growth; rather, it is a precondition for sustainable growth. More debt is not a prerequisite for successful structural reform. Quite the opposite is true: sound public finances are a crucial element of a successful reform strategy. Any attempt to trade off reforms against higher structural deficits would pave the way for budgetary arbitrariness, undermining the credibility of the rules. Judging by past experience, it is clear to me that it will take more than simply stiffening the rules to enforce the principle of individual responsibility.Essentially, this principle requires sovereigns, banks and investors to bear the consequences of their decisions. Juergen Donges wrote in a recent comment: The principal of individual responsibility includes the possibility of bank and sovereign insolvencies.The BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism will allow banks to be resolved in a more orderly manner. However, in terms of restructuring sovereign debt, little progress has been made so far.The principal of individual responsibility requires that it is primarily up to the respective government and its citizens to come up with the revenue required to repay public debt. This holds, in particular, since high levels of public debt often go hand in hand with substantial private assets.But it also implies that the risk of non-repayment ultimately lies with investors, since they are the ones who reap the return when things go well. And if the fiscal limit has been reached for real, public debt will need to be restructured without posing a systemic threat to financial stability.The introduction of collective action clauses in sovereign bonds was a first step in that direction. But more steps are needed. The Bundesbank has put forward a proposal for sovereign bonds to include an automatic maturity extension of three years in case a sovereign needs to make use of the European rescue mechanisms.This automatic maturity extension would allow the sovereign in question to tackle its fiscal challenges while preventing investors from bolting. Liability and control would be brought better into balance. That would reduce the amount of official financial support, and buy time to figure out whether the problem is one of temporary illiquidity or insolvency.But ultimately, all these questions boil down to the quip by American economist Allan Meltzer: Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It doesn't work.For the above proposals to work, we need to make sure that the restructuring of both banks and sovereign debt is possible without bringing down the financial system as a whole. At the moment, this is perceived as an unpredictable risk.What do we need to do to make this risk manageable?      At the core of the problem lies what is now known as the sovereign-bank nexus. In the crisis, this sovereign-bank nexus developed into a vicious circle: Tottering banks and teetering sovereigns lean towards each other for support, but are in fact pushing each other over.If a large bank or one which is strongly interconnected with other banks runs into difficulties, this can pose a threat to the stability of the entire financial system. The state then often has no other option but to step in if it wants to prevent a meltdown of the real economy. To quote the ESRB's Advisory Scientific Committee: Banks' liabilities are taxpayers' contingent liabilities.As a result, necessary rescues can become a huge burden for government finances. This is what happened in Ireland, where the need to prop up the financial system pushed the public debt ratio up by nearly 30 percentage points. Conversely, weak government positions can destabilise banks - directly through their exposure to sovereign bonds, and indirectly through worsening macroeconomic conditions. This was the case in Greece.How can we break this doom loop?The strengthened Basel III capital rules are a first step in that direction, as they increase capital buffers and thus the capacity of banks to absorb losses. The banking union, with its Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), is another such step. Strict and stringent supervision ensures that tough rules are applied equally to all.The SSM is important for severing the link between banks and sovereigns. But to make sure that banks cannot pass on the consequences of their actions to the public, more is needed. An effective recovery and resolution mechanism including a bail-in regime that clearly assigns how losses are distributed augments the SSM.Shareholders and creditors should be first in line to absorb losses. It is therefore to be welcomed that the Directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of failing banks (BRRD) and the regulation creating the Single Resolution Mechanism have been agreed upon.The sovereign-bank nexus works both ways, however. We also have to make sure that worsening public finances do not infect the financial system.The banking union still has a sovereign virus, as Daniel Gros from the Centre for European Policy Studies once quipped. To strengthen the banking union's immune system, we need to put an end to the preferential treatment afforded to sovereign debt.At present, sovereign bonds are treated by European regulators as being risk-free, even though recent history has taught us that the opposite is true: sovereign bonds are not risk-free assets. Hence, sovereign bonds should be adequately risk-weighted, and exposure to individual sovereign debt should be capped, as is already the case for private debt.These changes might trigger substantial repercussions, but they would be manageable if they were phased in over a transitional period - which would undoubtedly need to be granted.Despite these repercussions the changes would be worth because they would make banks more resilient if the fiscal position of the respective sovereign were to deteriorate. And it would bring spreads more into line with the underlying risk, thus sending a disciplining signal to the sovereign.At the current juncture when it comes to sovereign bonds, banks all too often seem to neglect this principle of risk diversification. In many cases, European banks hold bonds from one sovereign only - their home country. During the crisis, many banks, particularly weak ones, used the low refinancing costs to buy even more sovereign debt; they made a sort of carry trade.Between end-November 2011 and end-May 2014, Spanish banks expanded their holdings of Spanish government debt securities by 74  percent, from Euro165 billion to Euro288 billion. 92  percent of Spanish banks' euro-area sovereign portfolios are domestic.Only Italian, Greek and Slovakian banks are even more home-biased. However, it is the high level of undiversified sovereign exposures which makes sovereign default a potentially systemic event.Consistently applying the stiffened rules and putting an end to the preferential treatment afforded to sovereign debt will be instrumental in strengthening the stability of our monetary union. So will the banking union.Currently, much of the support provided to the whole structure hinges on one pillar alone: monetary policy. But this can only work for so long; monetary policy has already done a lot to absorb the economic consequences of the crisis, but it cannot resolve the crisis.There is still truth in what Wim Duisenberg, the first President of the ECB, once said: Don't ask for monetary policy to perform tricks it cannot deliver. Therefore, the best contribution the Eurosystem can make to a lasting resolution of the crisis is to fulfil its mandate: that of maintaining price stability.The Eurosystem's crisis measures have helped prevent the crisis from escalating. However, some of these measures have, as I have repeatedly pointed out, taken the Eurosystem to the outer edge of its mandate. Meanwhile, the comprehensive measures agreed by the Governing Council of the ECB in June cannot, in my opinion, be compared with the crisis measures taken two or three years ago.The current measures do not provide for individual countries' liability risks to be taken onto the Eurosystem's balance sheet. The task now is to prevent an excessively long period of low inflation. Because that could paralyse the euro area's economy.Governor Linde will certainly confirm that the June decision was preceded by much soul-searching as to how best to proceed. These measures are also associated with risks and side-effects, which we would be wrong to play down.In the long term, the ultra-loose monetary policy poses risks to financial stability. There is a danger of exaggerations on the asset and real estate markets - just think of the hunt for yield.Low interest rates also ease the pressure on governments to vigorously tackle their countries' problems. There is a danger that the low interest rates will be used not to consolidate budgets, but to finance additional spending.This is why the Governing Council so insistently calls for sound public finances as a prerequisite for a stability-oriented monetary policy. Or to say it with the words of Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England:  Central banks are often accused of being obsessed with inflation. This is untrue. If they are obsessed with anything, it is with fiscal policy.So it is particularly important to make it quite clear now that the Eurosystem will not put off a necessary increase in central bank interest rates out of consideration for public finances. Looking at the euro area, I would therefore say that monetary policy has done its bit towards maintaining price stability. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.The crisis has laid bare shortcomings at the national level as well as weaknesses in the monetary union's institutional architecture.Repairs at the national level have seen considerable progress, though there is still a long way to go. Like in a marathon, the second half of the course always feels tougher than the first - and one major challenge is to not give in to the growing reform fatigue.But at this point, the weaknesses in EMU's architecture probably pose a more fundamental challenge. The balance between liability and control has got out of kilter. We need to regain that balance if we are to put EMU on a more solid footing.Since a genuine fiscal union is not on the cards - and to me, it does not seem to be for the foreseeable future - we need to make the principle of individual responsibility work. But we also need to put an end to the preferential treatment afforded to sovereign debt in order to immunise the financial system against sovereign default.Finally, monetary policy must not allow itself to be misappropriated for fiscal policy purposes. Otherwise it cannot fulfil its mandate, which is price stability.And now I am looking forward to hearing your views on this matter.",2014-07-18,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-07-18,"Madrid","Spain","Madrid Stock Exchange","Towards a more stable European monetary union",4842,20.5,5,41.8,12.3,"EN"
"2014-07-23 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","According to geological surveys, around 7,000 years ago, Europe looked quite different from what it looks today. A single land mass, known as Doggerland, stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and Denmark. Britain was not an island, but an integral part of continental Europe.The end of the Ice Age seems to have ushered in the end of Doggerland as well. The melting ice caused the level of the North Sea to rise until the land mass was fully submerged.An alternative hypothesis suggests that Britain's separation from Europe came with a bang rather than a whimper. A huge tsunami triggered by a sub-marine landslide off the coast of Norway, the Storegga Slide, is supposed to have cut Britain off from mainland Europe.Whatever the ultimate cause, the fact remains that today Britain and Europe are still divided geographically by the English Channel. But human enterprise has managed to bridge this divide, or rather, it has tunnelled it. And just as the resolve of the Eurotunnel engineers has shortened the journey from Paris to London to less than two and a half hours, so the dedication of post-war statesmen has overcome the political and economic divisions that had troubled Europe for so long.Almost to the day a hundred years ago, Kaiser Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary declared war on the kingdom of Serbia. That marked the start of the first of two global wars, which together cost the unfathomable number of more than 80 million lives.In 1946, only a year after the atrocities originated by Germany had ended, a European statesman proposed a remedy to this tragedy of Europe. The proposal was as simple as it was bold - to re-create the European family.  What sounded utopian at the time is reality today. Rarely has a political vision been more vindicated than the one laid out by Winston Churchill in Zurich in 1946. Europe has finally found the peace that had eluded it for so long.The recent tensions in the Ukraine, however, serve as a strong reminder that we should never take peace for granted, not in Europe, nor anywhere else in the world.Churchill's vision was a political one. But the re-creation of the European family was advanced largely by the integration of national economies. And while peace and stability are rightly the most celebrated achievements of the European Union, economic integration has produced remarkable results in its own right. Economic integration raises welfare through two mechanisms: first, via increased trade, and second, via increased competition, which in turn strengthens innovation and productivity. Judging economic developments against a non-existing counterfactual, in this case non-integration, is obviously a tricky business. But the studies available show that the effect is sizeable in any case. Europe is wealthier because of economic integration, with estimates of the output boost ranging from 5 percent to more than 25 percent.And it seems that Britain, too, has gained. Half of its trade is with the European Union, and studies suggest that EU membership has boosted Britain's trade in goods with other EU countries by more than 50 percent. The Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics has found that the immediate benefits of increased trade amount to 1¼ percent to 3 percent of GDP. And if the longer-term effects of strengthened competition and increased productivity are taken into account as well, EUmembership is estimated to have provided a boost of up to 10.5 percent of GDP.But as much as the UK gains from being part of the EU, so the EUgains from having the UK as a member. The EU is stronger today because of Britain's contribution to it. The European economy is more open and dynamic as a result of Britain's commitment to open and flexible markets - a position very much in tune with the Bundesbank's, I might add.And that commitment to open and flexible markets holds the promise of even bigger returns. A lot of the potential inherent in our most important European catalyst for growth, the single market, is still untapped.The single market has been very successful in facilitating trade in goods. Hence, competition in this area is intense. The mark-ups that firms are able to charge in addition to their costs due to market power are low and are comparable to those in the US, for example. When it comes to services, however, the picture looks different. Mark-ups are higher, on average, than in the US. It is probably safe to say that the Services Directive has fallen short of expectations.Britain, in particular, with its advanced services sector stands to gain from dismantling the existing barriers to cross-border trade in services. Originally, the Services Directive was designed to establish the so-called country of origin principle that already holds for EU trade in goods. This principle states that a services firm should no longer be hampered by regulation in the import country if it has already complied with the national regulations in its home country.However, the final version of the directive did not include this principle. Simulations carried out by the Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis show that by dropping it, the expected output boost as a result of the Services Directive is reduced by some 40 percent. Completing the single market for services therefore holds the promise of substantial economic gains.The same goes for bringing the single market into line with the digital age. When it comes to the digital economy, fragmentations still abound, in particular with regard to legal issues such as privacy and data protection, content and copyright, liability of online intermediaries, e-payments and electronic contracts. The EU is still comprised of 28 individual digital markets rather than one single digital market.This is holding back innovation, growth and, ultimately, jobs. Studies suggest that establishing a harmonised and well-regulated digital single market holds the same potential as the introduction of the original one, raising GDP by as much as 4 percent. In Germany, for example, this could imply an additional 427,000 jobs over the period 2015 to 2020.Some steps have already been taken towards a true single market for the digital economy, but we are not there yet. Continuing to the end would provide a major boost to European competitiveness. It is therefore more than worth the effort.Ladies and gentlemen, the field of policy which has seen the most far-reaching centralisation in Europe is clearly the field of monetary policy, at least for the 18 member states of the euro area. But the mutualisation of monetary policy is not only an issue for the euro-area member states but for all European countries. Our extensive trade links imply that developments in the monetary union reverberate in the non-euro-area countries as well, as the crisis has shown very forcefully.The euro area teams up one common monetary policy with 18 national fiscal and economic policies. This approach reflects a currency area composed of sovereign member states. It grants member states sufficient leeway to preserve their diversity, that is, to establish their own business models or to tailor institutions and policies to their own national preferences. At the same time, it leaves the consequences of such decisions with the respective member state and consistently rules out the option of mutualising public debt with other euro-area states.But this set-up also creates vulnerabilities. First, a combination of this kind gives rise to a deficit bias, as it allows the costs of fiscal imprudence to be shifted partially on to others. An unsustainable fiscal situation in one country has repercussions for monetary union as a whole. You can compare this to what economists call the tragedy of the commons. Just as overfishing creates negative externalities for other countries, excessive public debt harms the euro area as a whole. Excessive debt in one member state drives up longer-term interest rates for all euro-area countries.And second, each member state issues debt in a currency it cannot create. Hence, a high level of fiscal discipline is needed to ensure that solvency concerns do not spiral out of control.For monetary policymakers focussing on maintaining price stability, the question of how to safeguard public finance is thus of particular concern. As so often, Mervyn King put it most aptly when he said that Central banks are often accused of being obsessed with inflation. This is untrue. If they are obsessed with anything, it is with fiscal policy.The founding fathers of the euro clearly foresaw the risk of unsustainable public finances for a stability-oriented monetary policy. That is why precautions were put in place to safeguard sound public finances and to protect monetary policy. They took the form of a prohibition of monetary financing of government deficits, the no bail-out clause and the Stability and Growth Pact.But the precautions taken in the Maastricht Treaty to ensure sound public finances have proven insufficient. The rules of the Stability and Growth Pact have been broken numerous times in the past, not least by Germany, France and Italy. And the no bail-out clause failed to exert the expected disciplining effect on governments in the run-up to the crisis, as markets did not account enough for different macroeconomic developments in the countries concerned. In this way, the markets might have anticipated that concerns about financial stability would deter the euro-area member states from rigorously applying the no bail-out clause. And that is precisely what happened when the crisis broke out.The rescue packages provided to countries which lost market access did help to calm the situation. But at the same time, they have thrown the balance between liability and control out of kilter. While spending decisions essentially remain a national prerogative, liability has become partially mutualised. The tendency to incur further debt is thus strengthened, not weakened. What is to be done? Some necessary steps have already been taken. The fiscal rules have been stiffened, with greater automaticity in the Stability and Growth Pact and the introduction of the fiscal compact.However, as we have learned in the crisis, rules have to be applied to fulfil their purpose, and they can only be the first line of defence. They need to be complemented by a functioning market discipline to counter the temptation not to observe the rules. Sound public finances will only be achieved if we rigorously set about restoring the balance between liability and control.One way to do this would be a genuine fiscal union. If common debt were matched by common control, incentives could be aligned. But this would require a quantum leap in terms of ceding sovereignty to the European level, a leap neither the electorates nor the governments of the member states seem willing to take.If a true fiscal union that requires extensive changes to the European Treaties is not on the cards, then we need to take the second avenue. That implies taking concrete steps towards restoring a balance of individual control and individual responsibility within the existing Maastricht framework. A framework which is in line with what Margaret Thatcher once said in her famous speech at the College of Europe - that improving the workings of the European Union does not automatically require stronger centralisation.Individual responsibility requires that sovereigns, banks and investors bear the consequences of their decisions. This means that it is primarily up to the respective government and its citizens to come up with the revenue needed to repay public debt. This holds, in particular, since high levels of public debt often go hand in hand with substantial private assets.But it also implies that the risk of non-repayment ultimately lies with the investors, since they are the ones who reap the return when things go well. And if the fiscal limit has been reached for real, public debt needs to be restructured without posing a systemic threat to financial stability.The introduction of collective action clauses into sovereign bonds was a first step in that direction. But more steps are needed. The Bundesbank has put forward a proposal for sovereign bonds to include an automatic maturity extension of three years in case a sovereign accesses the European rescue mechanisms. This automatic maturity extension would allow the sovereign in question to tackle its fiscal challenges while preventing investors from bolting. The amount of official financial support would be reduced, and time could be bought to figure out if the problem is one of temporary illiquidity or insolvency.But ultimately, all these questions boil down to the quip of American economist Allan Meltzer: Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It doesn't work. For the above proposals to work, we need to make sure that sovereign insolvencies are possible without bringing down the financial system as a whole.To that end, doing away with the preferential treatment of sovereign debt in banks' balance sheets is of the essence. The current regulatory framework permits preferential treatment of sovereign exposures in various forms.While bank exposures to a single counterparty are limited, in principle, to a quarter of their eligible capital, exposures to sovereigns are exempted from that large exposures regime. Thus, many European banks hold bonds from one sovereign only - their home country. But a high level of undiversified sovereign exposure is what makes sovereign default a potentially systemic event. For this reason, the large exposures regime needs to apply to sovereigns as well.Moreover, sovereign exposures are privileged by low or zero capital requirements. An adequate risk-weighting of sovereign bonds would make banks more resilient if the fiscal position of the respective sovereign were to deteriorate. And it would bring spreads more into line with the underlying risk, thus sending a disciplining signal to the sovereign.If additional capital requirements for European banks were imposed to cover sovereign exposures, the additional capital would be rather small on aggregate - albeit with substantial differences between banks. The inclusion of sovereigns in the large exposures regime might lead to more substantial repercussions. But these would be manageable if introduced over a transition period - which without question has to be granted.Obviously, establishing a sustainable fiscal framework and consolidating public budgets are only two of the numerous challenges facing the euro area in becoming more stable. Equally important is to correct macroeconomic imbalances - through the restoration of competitiveness in those countries that have fallen behind and through a further reduction of indebtedness in the private sector there.Declining unit labour costs and reduced current account deficits due also to increasing exports show that we have already come a long way in regaining competitiveness. At the same time private debt declined somewhat, reducing the burden on households' and enterprises' shoulders a bit.But as in a marathon, the last kilometres are always the hardest. What remains especially challenging is the intended increase of growth potential. Additional structural reforms are certainly needed - and, by the way, not only in the countries under stress but in Germany, too.By the same token, further work has to be done with respect to financial regulation, and that applies not only to the euro area, but globally. Some key objectives in this respect are: spelling out international standards on the loss-absorbing capacity of systemically important banks, achieving cross-border acceptance of a bank resolution, peer reviewing measures regulating the shadow banking sector and establishing saver derivative markets.Ladies and gentlemen, let me come to a close.Britain and continental Europe may not be connected by Doggerland anymore, but there are myriad other ties that bind us together to form a common Union.And it is precisely because our views sometimes differ that we are, together, more than the sum of our parts. If Britain continues to make its voice heard in Europe, I am confident that the Union will become more outward-looking, open and prosperous for that.To those who think Europe would be better off giving in to the temptation of insularity, let me say it in the words of the Beatles: You say goodbye, and I say hello.",2014-07-23,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-07-23,"London","UK","Annual Dinner of the German-British Chamber of Commerce","Dinner speech",2693,19.4,5,41.7,12.2,"EN"
"2014-07-24 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","I am delighted that so many of you have been able to attend our press briefing. But before we kick off, I would first like to make a couple of points of my own.I am certainly not overstating the case when I describe the banking union as the most ambitious European project since the launch of the euro. Yet at the same time, it represents a step forward that is as necessary as it is logical. A single monetary policy calls for integrated financial markets, and that includes the banking union.The banking union is set to become a reality on 4 November this year - at least in the form of the European Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The second pillar of the banking union - the European Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) - does not come into play until 2016. The third pillar - a joint European deposit guarantee scheme - has been shelved for the time being.But the main topic I would like to discuss with you today is the Single Supervisory Mechanism.Much remains to be done before the SSM can set to work on 4 November. The biggest project leading up to the launch of the SSM is the comprehensive assessment, in which a total of 128 banks across Europe will be subjected to a thorough health check, including a cardiac stress test. This check aims to provide maximum transparency and strengthen confidence among market players, and to enable the SSM to get down to work free of legacy issues.The comprehensive assessment is made up of two core components. The first is the asset quality review, or AQR. To stay with the medical metaphor, the AQR is rather like looking at an X-ray image - it allows supervisors to detect any nasty surprises that might be lurking on bank balance sheets. The second component is a stress test. This cardiac stress test gives an outlook for the patient's health going forward. Its aim is to gauge the extent to which banks can withstand a deterioration in the economic setting.The bulk of the on-site inspections performed as part of the AQR have now been completed. These inspections focused on scrutinising credit exposures and collateral valuations, looking both at individual exposures and aggregate portfolios. The resulting data were used to ascertain whether there was any need for valuation adjustments. Level 3 fair value exposures were also inspected.The findings, having been quality-assured at the national level, have, over the past weeks, been forwarded to the ECB, which is now engaged in central quality assurance. The next step will be to calculate an AQR-adjusted capital ratio. After that, banks will be asked to make the adjustments needed under the accounting standards.In the stress test, banks need to simulate two macroeconomic scenarios, the aim being to discover how each bank's risks, and thus their CET1 ratios, respond under stress conditions. The baseline scenario is largely consistent with the European Commission's 2014 winter forecast, whereas the adverse scenario simulates a much more difficult economic setting in which the euro area experiences a recession, with GDP shrinking by 0.7  percent in 2014 and by 1.4  percent in 2015, followed by zero growth in 2016. This simulated economic slump is accompanied by rising unemployment and falling prices in the financial and real estate markets. At the same time, the scenario simulates an increase in general interest rate levels as well as renewed divergence in European sovereign bond spreads.The final step of the comprehensive assessment is joining up the AQR findings with the outcome of the stress test. Generally speaking, we should work from the bottom up wherever possible - in other words, on the basis of the specific data provided by the banks. Generalised assumptions should be made as little as possible. But the tight time schedule naturally means that some trade-offs will need to be made. Publication of the final outcome of the comprehensive assessment is scheduled for the second half of October.As I see it, clear communication is crucial for the success of the comprehensive assessment. The process needs to be as transparent as possible, and banks should be involved at the earliest possible stage, ad hoc reporting requirements permitting. In any case, supervisors constantly interact with the banks throughout the comprehensive assessment, from the clarification of issues during the credit file reviews through to the supervisory dialogue, which is when representatives from the ECB and the national competent authorities discuss partial and preliminary findings before the final results are disclosed.There is one point I would like to make quite clear. These inspections are being conducted in an even-handed and open-minded manner. At the current juncture, it is simply impossible to say with any certainty how the results will turn out. That's why I find it downright ill-considered for third parties to suggest that they know the outcome. Bearing this in mind, I trust you will appreciate that the Bundesbank will refrain from making any further public statements on the comprehensive assessment as from mid-September.If the AQR or the stress test reveal any capital shortfalls, it will be up to the banks to cover them as quickly as they can, first and foremost by approaching their stakeholders for additional funding. No later than two weeks after publication of the results, institutions will be required to submit capital plans in which they explain in detail how they intend to cover any capital shortfall.However, let us not forget one thing. The comprehensive assessment is based on balance sheet data as at 31 December 2013. When considering the published results, it is therefore important to pay particular attention to the column listing the capital measures taken in 2014. We expressly welcome the fact that several banks have strengthened their capital base in recent months. This helps make the banking system more stable.If there are not enough private funds to fill any capital shortfalls identified, the state in question will be obliged to provide a backstop. As a last resort, the government is to recapitalise banks, issue guarantees or take on risks. However, this government support is subject to strict conditions. The bank must be solvent, and the support must not offset any accrued losses. Moreover, government assistance may be granted only if it serves to avert disruption to the real economy or dangers to financial stability.The comprehensive assessment is a major organisational undertaking for all involved, and one which must, furthermore, be implemented under massive time pressure. At its peak, more than 1,700 auditors and 230 Bundesbank and BaFin supervisors were involved in Germany alone. Moreover, my experience in the Bundesbank is that, ultimately, far more colleagues are, of course, involved in the comprehensive assessment than just those officially assigned to the project. Some are helping out temporarily or indirectly, while others have had to take on tasks originally performed by staff now directly involved with the comprehensive assessment.For banks, too, taking part in the assessment involves a lot of work. And yet, the comprehensive assessment is decisive if the Single Supervisory Mechanism is to get off to a good start.Under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the ECB will take on direct responsibility for supervising the 120 most significant euro-area banks from 4 November.What does that mean for Germany? First, BaFin and the Bundesbank will continue to directly supervise around 2,000 smaller German credit institutions; second, we will hand over direct supervisory responsibility for the 21 German SSM banks to the ECB, but will continue to provide them with ongoing supervision; third, we will be involved in supervising the 99 foreign SSM banks.How will that work in practice? Supervision of the SSM banks will pass to what are known as Joint Supervisory Teams. These teams will be headed by an ECB coordinator. Under current plans, the coordinator of a Joint Supervisory Team may not come from the country in which the supervised bank is headquartered.The teams themselves are largely made up of staff from the national competent authorities. The Bundesbank and BaFin will consequently continue to supervise the German SSM banks. That ensures that national supervisors' expertise is not lost. In terms of the Bundesbank, it is not just our know-how and experience that count, but also the fact that we have offices in those locations where the banks are headquartered and operate - whether that be Munich or Hamburg.The SSM's clout hinges on the people behind it. And herein, too, lies a major challenge. The ECB is planning to employ around 770 staff for the new supervisory body. In addition, it is looking for some 200 employees to undertake support functions.Given the proximity, moving to the ECB is, of course, particularly attractive for Bundesbank staff working in Frankfurt. So far, 48 colleagues have taken up regular SSM positions, nine of which are managerial positions, including one Deputy DG post, while 32 have taken working level positions and 7 are employed in support functions. In addition, 19 Bundesbank staff are currently seconded to the ECB to assist with the SSM on a temporary basis. A very prominent example of a Bundesbanker currently working for the ECB is, of course, our former Deputy President, Sabine Lautenschläger.As the majority of the selection decisions are yet to be taken, we expect more Bundesbank staff to switch to the ECB by November. To fill the resultant gaps, we carried out what we refer to as frontloading at the beginning of the year. Our plan is to fill any vacancies that arise in the meantime as rapidly as possible by advertising internally and externally and by allocating more junior staff to the area.Allow me to mention one last point. Who will pay for the new European supervisory authority? How can the costs be distributed fairly across institutions, and what is the right allocation key? In my opinion, all banks should be involved, albeit in proportion to their size and risk weight. A level playing field can be guaranteed only if supervisory activity is exercised appropriately, ie in proportion to a bank's size and risk. The Bundesbank is particularly committed to this objective, but our ECB colleagues have also stressed this to be a concern. Ultimately, however, smaller institutions will also benefit from the Single Supervisory Mechanism, even if they are not supervised by the ECB directly.Ladies and gentlemenWe have set ourselves an ambitious goal, to make the financial system more stable. The banking union is, without doubt, one of the largest steps towards achieving this objective. I am confident that it will get off to a smooth start when the Single Supervisory Mechanism is launched on 4 November. Then, when the Single Resolution Mechanism starts its work in 2016, we will have gone a long way towards creating a more stable financial system. However, there is still a lot of work to be done.",2014-07-24,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-07-24,"Frankfurt","Germany","Hintergrundgespräch mit Journalisten","European banking union: Where do we stand?",1803,19.1,4.9,45.3,11.6,"EN"
"2014-09-04 - BuBa - Claudia Buch.txt","The topic of this conference is banks in transition. It is not just the banking sector, but also banking supervision, that is experiencing a transitional phase.The creation of the banking union is a mammoth project which is being implemented with breathtaking speed. In May 2013, a comment in a newspaper - not the Handelsblatt - included the following line: No self-respecting European is refraining from calling for the speedy launch of the banking union in public speeches at present. Today, just under 16 months later, the banking union is truly just around the corner. The question now is whether it can actually fulfil the expectations and hopes bound up in it.My predecessor at the Bundesbank, Sabine Lautenschläger, already spoke at length about the imminent launch of the Single Supervisory Mechanism yesterday. I would therefore like to begin by just briefly outlining the key facts about the upcoming sea change. In the second half of October the results of the comprehensive assessment will be published. The European Central Bank will assume responsibility for banking supervision in November. It will directly supervise the 120 most significant banks, including 21 German institutions. The ECB can also take on supervision of smaller banks. This is appropriate, as even these institutions can give rise to risks, for instance if they have similar business models and are hit by a common shock. The savings and loans crisis in the United States at the end of the 1980s and the Spanish cajas crisis are striking examples of this. The Single Supervisory Mechanism is just one pillar of the banking union, however. The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), which is scheduled to enter into force at the start of 2016, will introduce a European resolution authority and a bank resolution fund.The emerging banking union comes with many expectations: the integration of the financial markets is to be promoted, risks of banks and governments untangled, and the stability of banks improved.Similar expectations were attached to the introduction of the euro. The Delors Report of 1989 already highlighted that in a single market for financial services within a monetary union, a single monetary policy could make a positive contribution to financial market integration.I consider the banking union to be an important and necessary extension of monetary union. It closes a vulnerable gap in the single currency by harmonising rules for the supervision and resolution of credit institutions at the European level and establishing European supervisory authorities. This is important, regardless of whether you wish to continue monetary union in the spirit of a Maastricht 2.0 with decentralised responsibility for fiscal policy or to develop it into a fiscal union with mutualisation of liability and control.In the Eurosystem, the ECB provides banks with liquidity in its capacity as lender of last resort. Supervision organised purely along national lines is no longer fitting with the times. Liquidity assistance from national central banks can have an impact on the single monetary policy. The restructuring or resolution of financial institutions can overstretch the individual member states' financial means.The banking union does not mean an extension of joint fiscal liability, however - its aim is anything but that. Rather, the banking union can play a role in establishing the liability principle at the European level in a better way than before. In future, private investors will have to shoulder losses. By contrast, public funding mechanisms may only be used in very tightly restricted exceptional cases, for example if the stability of the entire financial system is at risk. And if public funds have to be used, these should be national funds in the first instance.In this sense, the comprehensive assessment serves to ensure that apparent legacy risks do not fall within the scope of the new supervision and resolution regime. They should instead remain where they arose - at the national level and under national control.So is the banking union the solution to our problems?It could be an important part of the solution. But further steps are needed to make it a success. First, we must - as previously addressed - ensure that private investors are adequately liable for losses incurred. Second, the banking union on its own is not the key to better separating the risks of banks and governments. We must also make further progress in regulation and put an end to the preferential treatment afforded to government debt instruments. Third, earlier reforms of the financial markets in Europe have focused on the banks. It should not be overlooked here that the integration of the markets for capital can make an important contribution to sharing opportunities and risks in monetary union.I would now like to proceed by discussing how the banking union can contribute to better identifying and handling risks. But first I shall address the question of how opportunities and risks are distributed across integrated financial markets.The European project is globally unique. Sovereign states have committed to integrating their markets for goods, labour and capital. The integration of the financial markets has made progress in many respects. In the years leading up to the outbreak of the financial crisis, European banks' claims within Europe had grown from 36  percent of GDP at the end of the 1990s to 77  percent in 2008. Since then, however, these claims have fallen back to around 48  percent of GDP.But the strong increase in banks' cross-border exposures masked the fact that the integration of the markets remained incomplete. In the banking sector, integration concentrated on the interbank market; credit markets for enterprises and deposit business remained predominantly national. In the big European countries, banks are mainly domestically owned. The integration of the markets for capital may have increased in Europe, but the ownership structures of many enterprises are nonetheless strongly national. Improved market integration is hindered by differences in national taxation and legal systems as well as by varying market practices. Political resistance to cross-border ownership structures is another factor.The relatively low level of integration in the markets for capital makes it difficult for risks to be assumed via the financial markets. A comparison with the United States shows that equity holdings there are dispersed much more widely throughout the entire country. If a negative shock hits an industry or a specific region, then this loss is spread widely beyond that region. The same applies to positive developments, which are reflected in higher dividends. Equity investors participate directly in economic risk and in gains and losses. Creditors, on the other hand, are not exposed to losses - except in the case of insolvency.Empirical studies for the United States show that integrated markets for capital cushion around 40  percent of the cyclical fluctuations between the US federal states. A share of around 25  percent is smoothed via the credit markets. Fiscal mechanisms cushion just 20  percent of shocks. Studies for Canada and Sweden as well as the German federal states come to similar conclusions.The integration of banks in Europe has certainly had positive effects on growth and investment. But the risks arising from integration were frequently overlooked. What would happen if assumed risks became loss events, if losses materialised, if European banks were hit by a bigger shock? None of these questions were seriously posed until the crisis struck.During the crisis, it became clear that many banks had taken on excessive risk. That's why they ran into funding problems almost simultaneously and had to offload exposures. The freed-up capital often provided inadequate protection against the remaining risks. Up until the crisis, however, there was no special insolvency law for banks that allowed creditors to be bailed in and took account of risks to financial stability.Fiscal and monetary policy had to step into the breach. The outcome is higher public fiscal debt and greater risks in central bank balance sheets. Some banks are still lumbered with legacy exposures and can only play an inadequate part in the necessary structural change in the real economy.In this situation, the banking union can play a significant role in better identifying risks in the future by way of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. At the same time, the Single Resolution Mechanism represents a considerable step towards improving the manner in which risk is handled in a monetary union made up of sovereign states.Identifying risks better is the aim of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. It was designed to roll out uniform supervisory standards across all participating member states. The Single Supervisory Mechanism will thus make an important contribution to better integration of the markets, which is currently being hampered, amongst other things, by inconsistent supervisory standards.One of the major advantages of the Single Supervisory Mechanism is that it obtains comprehensive information. All supervisory reporting data for the most significant banks will thus be accumulated by a central authority in future. This information, which previously only existed at the national level, can be bundled to facilitate cross-border comparisons. In this way, the supervisor should be able to identify risks faster and better in future.The Single Supervisory Mechanism also reduces the risk of supervisors developing an all too close relationship with their banks. Local knowledge is certainly of great importance in the banking business. But we should also keep an eye on possible misaligned incentives in national supervision. Experiences in the United States show that local and national supervisors apply uniform supervisory standards with varying levels of strictness. This is why we should do our utmost to apply rules uniformly in Europe, thereby creating a genuine level playing field for banks.There are also areas in which the institutional framework can be improved for efficient European supervision. First, different tasks are bundled in the ECB. Alongside its actual task of monetary policy, the ECB Governing Council is ultimately also responsible for supervisory issues. These relate to microprudential and macroprudential supervision, with the latter addressing the stability of the financial system as a whole. If, however, monetary policy decisions are influenced by supervisory considerations, this would significantly impact on the credibility of monetary policy. Second, the non-euro-area countries in the ECB Governing Council are not entitled to vote. This hinders their inclusion in the banking union - and thus the integration of the banking markets in Europe as a whole. Central and eastern European countries, in which foreign banks have large market shares, are affected by this in particular. Clear-cut inclusion of these countries in the banking union would therefore be sensible for the creation of a single banking market. Third, the Single Supervisory Mechanism is extremely complex. A stringent organisational structure with clearly defined processes and reporting channels could alleviate the ensuing frictions, but certainly not eliminate them completely.We ought to keep a watchful eye on these problems. Practice will show whether they can be satisfactorily resolved within the existing legal framework. If this is not the case, then we should make the necessary adjustments.But having a uniform set of standards in banking supervision is not enough. We need procedures for dealing with banks that run into difficulties. What will happen in the future if the ECB, as the single supervisor, withdraws a bank's licence? How can we ensure that individual weak banks are able to exit the market?The second pillar of the banking union, the Single Resolution Mechanism, was designed to provide the answer to these questions. National solutions can normally be found for smaller ailing banks. In Germany, for example, there were a good 4,700 banks in the market at the start of the 1990s - today there are around 1,800. The bulk of these changes came about through mergers of smaller institutions with economically stronger ones.There are hardly any tried and tested mechanisms for restructuring and resolving major banks, however. Risks to financial stability can be posed if key business areas fail. Furthermore, coordination across national borders is required.These problems are not easy to resolve. All too often, stressed banks were given too much time to resolve the economic problems they faced. In earlier crises, finance ministers and supervisors often acted too late and too indecisively. Some shied away from the consequences of banking crises for government budgets, others from the loss of reputation for supervisors. Empirical studies indicate that banking crises come at a high real economic and fiscal cost. A wait-and-see strategy is the most expensive approach of all, however. That's why the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) is an important step towards better handling troubled banks. It harmonises the legal framework for bank resolutions in Europe. The BRRD defines the liability cascade: shareholders are liable first, followed by the creditors of subordinated and unsecured bonds. Depositors are protected up to Euro 100,000 by the statutory deposit guarantee scheme.If the capital freed up in this way is insufficient, funds from the single European resolution fund can be used, under certain conditions. This fund is intended to hold Euro55 billion. It is to be built up over time and funded by bank levies.The exact structure of this bank levy is currently being negotiated. Regardless of the details, it is particularly important in my view that the bank levy is as clear and simple to calculate as possible and does not allow for any exceptions.To ensure that liability and control are kept in balance, banks that are subject to European supervision also need to be resolved at the European level. But this also means that losses originating from the time before the launch of the banking union need to be remedied under national responsibility.With regard to resolution financing, national fiscal backstops and - as an ultima ratio - the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) are of central importance. In the case of legacy risks, it should also be taken into account that direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM breaches the liability principle. After all, the legacy risks arose on the watch of national supervisors.Practical application could reveal that subsequent improvements to the current institutional structures might be needed in two areas to ensure that the new resolution mechanisms are effective.First, the decision-making structures of the SRM - much like those of the Single Supervisory Mechanism - are extremely complex. The short deadline of one weekend will hardly be sufficient for a restructuring or resolution to be initiated at a large bank in a way that does not place an excessive strain on the system as a whole. For this reason, a check should be carried out on the extent to which the legal framework needs to be altered in order to arrive at more efficient decision-making structures in the resolution mechanism.The second problematic point is the authorities' relatively broad scope for discretion, which allows them to exclude private creditors from loss-sharing. This assessment is not an easy one to make. The higher the losses assumed by private creditors, the greater the potential negative effects for the stability of the financial system. The lower the private loss absorption, however, the higher the costs for government budgets - and the lower the disciplining effect for investors as well.The resolution authority therefore faces a conflict of interests: if it aims to deflect risks to financial stability, it must trust that ultimately a fiscal backstop will be available.The American model of systemic risk exception is of interest for implementing the liability principle and permitting as few exceptions from the bail-in of creditors as possible. The principle of bailing in creditors can only be deviated from in systemic crises. Each deviation must be approved by a clear majority of the relevant decision-making bodies - in this case, the deposit guarantee scheme and the central bank. The finance minister must sign off a deviation in consultation with the president. This is intended to secure the financing of bank restructurings. This is a sensible approach to strengthening the credibility of resolution regimes and being capable of acting during systemic crises at the same time.One point is of particular importance to me here: fiscal backstops are not the path towards to greater mutual liability. Fiscal means can only ever be the last resort within a well-defined liability cascade. But without this last resort, there is the risk of bank recoveries or resolutions being delayed. This is why it must be ensured in advance that fiscal means are available to plug any capital shortfalls in an emergency. Only then will the resolution authority at the head of the decision-making chain take on the risk of resolving a systemically important institution. This will make creditor bail-ins the rule and not the exception. This, in turn, is the prerequisite for risks being adequately priced by lenders.I mentioned three aims of the banking union at the beginning of my speech: more strongly integrated and also more stable financial markets, as well as the need to disentangle the risks of banks and governments.The banking union alone will not be able to achieve these aims, but it is a key building block that must be augmented and soundly anchored. I would like to emphasise three areas. First, credibly separating the risks of banks and governments requires further regulatory action plans. The banking union by itself does not change banking regulation. In future, the resilience of institutions will be strengthened by Basel III and the additional capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions. But this is not enough. The preferential treatment afforded to government debt instruments needs to be put to an end in the medium term. Sovereign bonds need, like other bank exposures as well, to be backed by capital. The existing limits on large exposures should be gradually extended to cover sovereign debt. Second, deeper integration of the markets for capital in Europe should be made possible. After all, cross-border investment allows opportunities - and risks - to be better shared. This strengthens the resilience of the financial system. Despite the essentially free movement of capital, there are still legal and institutional barriers in Europe. Third, the banking union can accelerate integration of the financial markets by introducing a common set of supervisory standards. But above all, it can also contribute to better risk assumption by the private sector. The Single Resolution Mechanism in particular is expected to make private investors participate in risks that materialise. But for this to become reality, the new rules need to be rigorously applied, and exceptions to the bail-in of creditors must be minimised.On the whole, the banking union means that the authority for supervising banks will be transferred to the European level. The need for this is nothing new - the Delors Report already pointed out exaggerations that financial markets are prone to, and the associated constraints that this entails for national economic policy.",2014-09-04,"BuBa","Claudia Buch",2014-09-04,"Frankfurt","Germany","19.

"2014-09-09 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","I am pleased to welcome you all to the reception we at the Deutsche Bundesbank are hosting here at the annual meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik.When I see so many economists assembled in one place, I am naturally tempted to tell one of the many economist jokes making the rounds. However, the short story I am about to tell you is also connected with the topic of my short speech.In the middle of the night, a policeman on his beat finds an economist walking around a lamp-post, looking down at the ground. What are you doing? the policeman asks. Looking for my wallet, says the economist. Where did you lose your wallet?, the policeman wants to know. The economist points to the other side of the street. It might be a better idea to look over there, the policeman advises. Well, but it's too dark over there.Dear guests, evidence-based economic policy is the motto of this year's annual meeting. What this motto implies is that economic policy-making should be based not on what we think we know about the world, but on what we actually do know about the world.This is ultimately in the tradition of Popper and his dictum that a good theory must be falsifiable. We therefore need empirical research. Empiricism is merely the attempt to falsify theories by subjecting them to a reality check. And only theories that stand up to such a reality check should be used as a basis for economic policy.Ideally, empirical review of theories is part of scientific practice. Sometimes, however, this reality check overtakes science and reveals, in a very real fashion, gaps in theory. The financial crisis was one such reality check.In October 2008, Alan Greenspan testified before the USCongress that the meltdown had left him in a state of shocked disbelief. Many economists and economic policy makers are likely to have had similar feelings.To the general public, the crisis represented the intellectual bankruptcy of economic research. Nearly two weeks ago, Chancellor Merkel also made reference to this. At the 5th Lindau Meeting on Economic Sciences (attended by Nobel Laureates in this field), she noted that we are coming from years in which one (...) did not always have the impression that economics already knew everything about the future.Many are now indeed wondering quite fundamentally what use economics is to society. The question of the usefulness of economics to society is probably also a reason why, at the aforementioned gathering of Nobel Laureates, the closing panel discussion was entitled How Useful is Economics - How is Economics Useful?Ladies and gentlemen, Christoph Schmidt, chair of the German Council of Economic Experts, was quoted in yesterday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper as saying that, Despite the uncertainty surrounding our statements, our work is still important because we can contribute to imposing a limited amount of order on a complex and uncertain world without feigning false certainties.The job of economics is to explain economic interrelationships and to use these explanations as a basis for making economic policy designed to increase public welfare. Economics is thus, if we accept that view, a discipline which is certainly of relevance to society.However, we must admit that economics has not always been up to the task. The financial crisis showed that there were many things about financial markets which we did not know, and that much of what we thought we knew was not reality-based. This is not least because, some of the time, economists act much like the one in the story I told you at the beginning. Often, they were looking where the light was, not necessarily where the knowledge was.In that vein, precisely what the standard macroeconomic models were lacking was the financial sector, which made these models incapable of predicting the financial crisis. The framework of these models therefore needs to be broadened. In the meantime, many high-ranking economists are working on integrating the financial sector into standard macroeconomic models: Mark Gertler, Lawrence Christiano, Massimo Rostagno, Roberto Motto and Markus Brunnermeier, to name but a few. Although progress is being made, research has not yet reached the finishing line.But why was the financial sector missing from the models? Well, it is undoubtedly very difficult to model it mathematically. This seems to have been a hurdle initially not regarded as being worth overcoming. For we thought we knew something about the financial markets which has now turned out to be false.We believed the financial markets would generally perform their task efficiently and smoothly. And if financial markets do what they are supposed to, at least most of the time, there is no need to model them specifically. However, it was the financial crisis, if not beforehand, which showed that the financial markets sometimes do not do what they are supposed to be doing - and on a large scale.Let me briefly give an example of a problem in the financial markets which, I believe, played a central role in the crisis: banks' systemic importance, the too-big-to-fail problem.It is a core tenet of market economies that firms can fail. Joseph Schumpeter called this creative destruction; Allan Meltzer put an even finer point on it: Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It doesn't work.Not taken into account with regard to banks were the side effects of failure. And one thing came to light in the crisis: these side effects can be so severe that failure is no longer the basis of a healthy market but, in a worst case scenario, the downfall of the market. In order to prevent such a downfall, central government has to intervene and rescue banks. By creating flawed incentives, this implicit government guarantee ultimately exacerbates the underlying problem - a problem that the markets believe has still not yet been solved, as studies by the IMF and other institutions show.Are these really new insights? No, this is certainly not news. It is precisely here in Germany where the premises of the ordo-liberal school of thought are cited in this context. Walter Eucken is quoted again and again with respect to the too-big-to-fail problem. More than 60 years ago, he came up with a short and snappy solution to the problem: Whoever reaps the benefits must also bear the liability.Incentives are appropriate only where the banks' shareholders and creditors are liable. And only where the banks' shareholders and creditors are liable will taxpayers not be asked to foot the bill. The knowledge that regulatory policy came up with a fundamental answer to the too-big-to-fail problem decades ago is not the end of the road, however.Although the principles of Ordnungspolitik are pointing in the right direction, they do not give us the precise route. They do not tell us the size at which a bank actually becomes too big to fail. They cannot help us understand the exact routes of contagion channels in the financial system. And they cannot help us develop the precise mechanisms for bailing in shareholders and creditors.We need formal models to solve these problems. And this brings us to what post-crisis economic research needs to achieve: it must pour old knowledge into new models. Economics needs to seek the answers to its questions where they are actually to be found, even though there might not be a lamp to shine a light on the solution.Ladies and gentlemen, economists are facing major challenges, for which they have recently received a lot of criticism but precious little praise. I am therefore glad to now present the Carl Menger Prize, which will be awarded biennially at our annual meeting. Since this is a first, I would like to begin by saying a thing or two about the prize.The Carl Menger Prize is awarded by the Verein für Socialpolitik in honour of innovative international research accomplishments in the field of monetary macroeconomics, monetary policy and foreign exchange policy - precisely the areas in which the crisis revealed gaps.Jointly awarded by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, the Swiss National Bank and the Bundesbank, the prize money is €20,000.Candidates can be nominated in written proposals detailing their worthiness by the heads of the research departments of the three central banks as well as by the heads of the Verein für Socialpolitik's committees for monetary theory and policy, macroreconomics, and external economics theory and policy.The lead editors of our association periodicals - the German Economic Review and Perspektiven der Wirtschaftspolitik - are also eligible to nominate candidates.The prizewinners are chosen by a vote among the Verein's former and current chairs and by one representative (each) of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, the Swiss National Bank and the Bundesbank.I would like to leave the technicalities of the new prize at that. What is much more interesting is: who will the prizewinner be?Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to announce that, for her outstanding academic achievements, the first Carl Menger Prize is awarded to - Ms Hélène Rey. Ms Rey, my warmest congratulations!Hélène Rey has been researching and teaching at the London Business School since 2007. Before that, she was at Princeton University and the London School of Economics. In her research, she particularly focuses on both the determinants and implications of globalisation for product and factor markets.Her findings help to better understand how, under current conditions, exchange rates are determined; how external imbalances emerge; and what pros and cons are associated with the further integration of the global economy.More recently, Hélène Rey has conducted research into how international capital flows can contribute to financial crises, and looked at the options central banks have in fulfilling their objectives in a globalised world.Hélène Rey’s research has not only substantially advanced the academic discussion; proving its practical relevance, it has also found its way into the concrete work of central banks.Ms Rey, among your academic contributions which can be found on your impressive list of publications, a preliminary working paper is entitled Exorbitant Privilege and Exorbitant Duty, referring to the specific role of the United States within the international monetary system.In this paper, you argue that privilege and duty are two sides of the same coin, which means they cannot be separated from one another. Fortunately, privilege and duty are not always inseparable in daily life.For with respect to this evening, I want to underscore that awarding the Carl Menger Prize to you is by no means a duty to me: quite simply, it is an absolute privilege and a pleasure.My colleagues from the Verein für Socialpolitik, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, the Swiss National Bank, the Bundesbank and certainly I personally, too, congratulate you wholeheartedly on being awarded the Prize and on your impressive academic achievements so far.May the Prize serve as an incentive for you to continue in this direction - we are definitely looking forward to your future work!",2014-09-09,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-09-09,"Hamburg","Germany","Jahrestagung des Vereins für Socialpolitik","The economist and the lamp-post - Lessons from the crisis",1819,19.9,5,44.6,11.7,"EN"
"2014-09-29 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","Some of you may already have visited the Regional Office to attend one of the events in our Bundesbank in dialogue series. If not, I can highly recommend it. Three weeks ago, Bundesbank experts were here providing information and fielding questions on the banking union. I hear that it was a very lively event.Today, we aren't here to discuss banks and the financial industry but to talk about ways to make our authorities and public institutions more effective overall, and I'm delighted that the Bundesbank is hosting this event.The setting in which we operate is evolving so rapidly that we also need to be swift in implementing the necessary changes in the right way.The ever-changing possibilities and requirements in the world of IT mean that we are constantly obliged to review our processes. Only recently, the Bundesbank set up a brand new data centre in the north of Frankfurt to make its IT infrastructure less prone to errors.Growing European integration is also changing the requirements we face. This is, of course, particularly true of the Bundesbank, as it forms part of the European System of Central Banks. Yet the Federal Employment Agency, the Federal Statistical Office and the German Patent Office are also embedded in a European framework, which means that they think and act in a European context. And I'm sure that the same can be said of many of you here today.For some of us, the European setting not only means being part of a European framework; it also creates quite specific competitive pressures. This is again particularly true of the Bundesbank; it often offers the same services as the central banks of the other euro-area countries. Yet it is not alone: the German weather services also have to compete with other providers in Europe. EU-wide tenders are already being held for certain meterological services designed to ensure safe air travel. The providers of these services therefore have to attract clients by offering top quality and service and competitive prices.In the world of politics, too, we are all competing with other ideas and approaches from across Europe. How can monetary policy best respond to the gloomier economic outlook and price prospects? How should the Single Supervisory Mechanism operate in future? What should we make of the idea to introduce a single European unemployment insurance scheme? These issues aren't just on the Bundesbank's agenda; they also occupy the German government and many of you here today, and they are met with a throng of proposals from across Europe on how to address them.Germany has rightly introduced a debt brake in response to the difficult public finance situation that this country is destined to face: fewer employees paying income tax and more pensioners. That is no easy scenario for our public coffers. The debt brake rules out the supposed quick fix of funding public expenditure through new borrowing.You don't need a crystal ball to see that the pressure on public authorities to provide their services cost-effectively is set to increase. And public authorities will also face increasing competition: they will be competing for scarce funds.I make no secret of the fact that, in this regard, the Bundesbank is undoubtedly in a better position than the public authorities. After all, it is not funded from the public coffers but from its own profit. But the Bundesbank, too, is monitored by the Federal Court of Auditors. Any euro that it wastes is one euro less for the Finance Ministry.The tighter budget will also reduce the options open to public authorities - including their ability to fulfil the public's wishes. I'm sure that is a fairly bitter pill for some of you to swallow, as focusing on the public's needs has been made a major priority in recent years - and with great success. A very recent Forsa study indicates that the public now rate the services provided by public authorities more positively than in previous years, which shows that they notice and appreciate these efforts.Yet this means that, in future, the authorities will need to be even more creative and willing to innovate in order to meet the growing demand to address the public's needs even when budgets are tight. Even so, it will probably no longer be possible to fulfil some of the public's wishes. For example, the Bundesbank now declines to accept coins in bags, as it is not cost-effective to do so. Accepting them would make life easier for some of the Bank's customers. But the Executive Board has decided on a wholesaler business model for cash processing, and so the Bank now only accepts standard coin containers.Despite our best efforts to innovate and find new solutions, we will all increasingly feel the squeeze, faced with limited funds and growing expectations to perform effectively.And, ultimately, competition for young talent is going to get tougher. Our so-called population pyramid already looks more like a mushroom. There are fewer and fewer young people entering the labour market, yet demand for highly qualified young workers in particular is growing ever larger.On the surface, it might seem reassuring that today's students seem particularly drawn to a career in the public sector. Students do not rate other sectors, such as the car industry, nearly as highly. And a third of students would like to work solely in the public sector, not in private industry.Ladies and gentlemen, as public-sector employers that is, of course, music to our ears. Yet I have my concerns about this desire among young people to work in the public sector. After all, Germany's economy is doing well, and there are a whole host of opportunities on the labour market for young people with qualifications. I feel that, for society as a whole, it is better if the mood among young people does not become too biased towards security and reliability.Ultimately, a market economy does not thrive on the work of public authorities but on successful business activities. Germany's prosperity is founded on innovation and the willingness of companies and their employees to take risks; it is based on them truly engaging with their customers' needs and on their openness to the rest of the world. And public authorities should create the best possible conditions for all this to take place.Given the changing needs in today's environment, we too need to innovate and be willing to adapt.I'd now like to give you a brief overview of the major challenges that the Bundesbank has faced since the turn of the millennium. The environment in which the Bank fulfils its statutory mandate has undergone numerous and major changes. And that is why the Bank already began with its target-based management more than ten years ago.In 2002, the Bundesbank decided to implement a fundamental structural reform which radically changed its set-up. European monetary union gave the Bundesbank a new role in Europe. The banking sector underwent a significant concentration process. Automated processes were introduced for many banking services. The Seventh Act Amending the Bundesbank Act (Siebente Bundesbankänderungsgesetz) ultimately provided the crucial impetus for a structural reform by further developing the tasks and set-up of the Bank. The Bundesbank made a virtue of necessity. It aligned its set-up to its role in the Eurosystem and became more cost-effective.At the same time, the launch of the Eurosystem gave rise to joint projects. In these projects, selected central banks - on behalf of all Eurosystem central banks - provide services for the Eurosystem or for European banks. This allows all concerned to benefit from greater efficiency. As a service provider, the Bundesbank is involved in the largest European projects on financial market infrastructure. We can therefore be sure that our standards are feeding into these areas. And, at the same time, we benefit from this cooperation with our partner central banks.That is true of TARGET2, a payment system operating across national borders in the EU, which the Bundesbank launched and now runs in cooperation with the central banks of France and Italy. This system enables banks to execute payments in real time and to settle transactions in central bank money. And it is also true of TARGET2-Securities, which will soon offer users throughout Europe a harmonised and centralised service for the settlement of securities in central bank money.Alongside the structural reform and the transfer of tasks and functions to the European level, the financial crisis is another factor that has radically changed the setting in which we operate. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) was launched in 2010. Since then, it has been responsible for macroprudential oversight of the financial system in the EU, focusing on risks to financial stability in the EU. The ESRB is also tasked with helping to ensure that the financial sector makes a sustainable contribution to economic growth. At the beginning of 2013, the Bundesbank was given a mandate to monitor financial stability in Germany. And the banking union will be launched in five weeks' time, on 4 November 2014. From that point on, the ECB will be responsible for European-level banking supervision. That won't put the Bundesbank's supervisors out of a job; far from it. But it will change some of the key focuses of their work.Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the dizzying pace of change in China at the turn of the millennium, it was said that you could be glad if your bed was still in your bedroom when you woke up in the morning. The pace of change in Europe is certainly slower than that - and, to borrow that same image, I would say that some countries' beds have remained in the bedroom far too long. Yet Europe is also experiencing rapid and major innovations - and that is bound to continue.In view of this situation, the Bundesbank views target-based management as a vital tool.Of course, the Bundesbank is not a private business. It isn't listed on the stock exchange, and its main customers are the general public, who benefit from a stable currency, a secure cash supply and payment systems which function smoothly.Target-based management ensures that the Bank is managed with results in mind. The focus here is on an effective and efficient use of resources. This is not only important for the Bundesbank, but probably for all public authorities. Ultimately, target-based management contributes to the objective of sound budgetary management, and this is also of significance at the macroeconomic level. After all, sound public finances are an essential precondition for sustainable economic growth and not a danger to it, as some commentators in the discussions on the euro area crisis - which is still far from over - would have us believe.At the Bundesbank, target-based management is implemented by a cutting-edge controlling department. This team of employees is responsible for the two important and intertwined building blocks of strategic planning and operational planning, for which the Bank adopted its first strategic plan in 2002 and its third in 2012.The strategy acts as an important roadmap, both within the Bank and externally. It provides clarity, which I already touched upon when talking about the wholesaler business model for cash processing. And, what's more, the strategy allows us to hold our own in the European competition for ideas, which I have also already mentioned. Ultimately, the strategy provides a framework for assigning resources to individual areas of responsibility and deciding which projects and measures should be implemented there.The title of my speech is Forging strategic plans without a crystal ball. Having a crystal ball would be the best of all worlds; there would be no uncertainty, no surprises, and no doubts about what the future holds - and all this with minimal resource input. At the Bundesbank, we are forced to make do without a crystal ball - and this means deploying considerable resources to produce economic forecasts. Strategic planning is a tried and tested instrument used by the Bundesbank to ensure that we are ready to respond to the influences of a dynamic environment at any given moment. We do this in a way that is as resource-efficient as possible.The primary objective of the Bundesbank is achieving its statutory mandate of ensuring price stability. In keeping with the idea of a strategic vision, we have defined the primary objective of our strategy in slightly broader terms. In our strategy we therefore speak of ensuring stability as opposed to merely ensuring price stability.We have used this strategic vision as the basis for defining a number of fields of activity, including, first and foremost, the tasks of our five core business areas. These are first, implementing monetary policy in Germany; second, and closely related to the first, maintaining the supply of cash; third, executing domestic and cross-border payments, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of payment and clearing systems; fourth, ensuring the stability of the financial and monetary system; and fifth, carrying out banking supervision.These core business areas are supplemented by a number of other fields of activity, such as statistics and research, which see to it that the right conditions are in place for successful work in the core business areas.In strategic planning terms, the Bank has learned new tricks with each round of planning. Our third strategy cycle, which involved drawing up the current Strategy 2016, was characterised by the realisation that a strategy only has a chance of being implemented if it is rooted across the entire institution.The strategy was therefore drawn up in a transparent, open process involving the senior management of our Central Office and our nine Regional Offices. At a management conference, the Executive Board discussed the Bank's strategic options with the senior managers of the business units at Central Office and the presidents of the Regional Offices.The conference rested on two pillars: top-down guidance outlining the Executive Board's fundamental approach and a discussion paper based on a scenario analysis. This discussion paper was prepared in advance by the Controlling Department in consultation with the responsible business units of the five core business areas.This management conference laid the groundwork for the future strategy. The Executive Board then set up working groups and tasked them - alongside Controlling - to develop strategic and development objectives as well as corresponding measures and indicators. The working groups presented their results to the Executive Board at a second management conference and the Controlling Department subsequently used these as a basis to prepare a draft Strategy 2016 for the Executive Board.The principles of transparency surrounding the strategy and its firm rooting within the organisation have been upheld to this day. Indeed, they are part of our everyday business life at the Bundesbank.For example, when providing information on the steps taken to develop the strategy, we did not limit ourselves to the various internal communication channels available. We also placed the adopted strategic and development objectives of each strategy on the Bank's intranet. Speeches at staff assemblies and talks with staff representatives form part of the traditional set of tools used to communicate internally within the Bank.At the Bundesbank we are also seeing very positive results from the new dialogue-oriented formats in which we openly invite a large number of employees to participate. For example, since 2012 we have been holding events with the appealing title Weidmann direct. Our employees are invited to these Regional Office events twice a year, where I speak about current topics and, above all, engage in dialogue. This form of direct contact is also offered by the Bundesbank's Deputy President - though here of course with the title Buch direct. We reach 250 employees directly in this way.In our event series Lunch with ..., things are significantly more focused on the individual. The format entails one member of the Executive Board going for lunch with 15 employees. Since 2012, this kind of lunch has been scheduled once a year for each member of the Executive Board.And, for nearly a year now, we have organised ad-hoc online chats on a specific subject. Regardless of their location, employees can direct questions to the member of the Executive Board taking part in the chat. On average, just over 400 employees follow these chats, which can be organised at very low cost.These various communication vehicles give the Executive Board the opportunity to clarify its strategic outlook and to garner employees' support. The new communication formats have been particularly well-received. In contrast to the existing formats that have been around for some time such as the Bank's employee magazine or the intranet, they are dialogue-oriented and largely open to everybody.So why am I talking about instruments of internal communication in the context of target-based management? Because, in my experience, they are decisive in ensuring that our strategy is worth more than the paper it's written on. It's only by working inwardly within our institution and taking our employees with us on this strategic journey that we will have any chance at all of reaching our destination.In this context, one of the results of the 2012 employee survey was particularly gratifying for me in my capacity as Bundesbank President: 65% of those surveyed feel they have a good level of knowledge on the Bundesbank's strategy. That's not bad going.In order to ensure support for our strategy among employees, it is also essential that the Executive Board identify with that strategy. The members of the Executive Board need to be seen to accept and respect it, even if it goes against the short term interests of their own area of responsibility. I am firmly convinced that without this visible support, it won't work.Indeed, sometimes implementing a strategy means having to face up to harsh realities. For example, some time ago the Executive Board took a strategic decision to streamline the branch network. At the start of the structural reform in 2002, the Bank still had over 100 branches. Today there are 41, providing coverage for the entire Federal Republic of Germany. This goes hand in hand with fundamental procedural changes that first need to take root in the organisation.In 1996, John Kotter, a pioneer in change management, was the first to suggest that only 30% of change efforts succeed. Numerous subsequent studies have confirmed this to be the case. One of the many responses to this has been to ascribe greater importance to the role of CEO and senior managers in the context of such changes.It therefore strikes me as pertinent that the working group Management and Controlling in Public Institutions has chosen Change Management as its annual topic for 2014-15.It is important to ensure that the aforementioned strategy is firmly anchored within the organisation but we also we also need target-based management. We can't have one without the other.In light of the environmental changes that I outlined at the start of my speech, once a strategy has been adopted it needs to be monitored on a regular basis to ensure it remains up to date. This is why we have annual strategy reviews, which look at both the extent to which strategic measures have been implemented and any changes that have occurred in the environment. These reviews also act as the basis for operational planning.Translating strategic planning into operational planning is a second challenging area of target-based management. The motivation and willingness of staff to implement a strategy is one thing, but translating this strategy into measurable - and therefore reviewable - operational objectives is quite another.What gets measured gets done is a well-known maxim in the Anglo-Saxon management literature. This is why we are in the process of devising a cascading series of measurable indicators for our strategic goals. This too, is anything but trivial. Indeed, there are grounds for a lively debate about whether some indicators accurately measure the phenomenon they are supposed to gauge.Please allow me to explain the way indicators are assigned to strategic goals using the example of external communication.The core objective of external communication is to ensure that the Bundesbank’s positions are communicated credibly, consistently, transparently and effectively to the outside world.We have broken this down into a number of development targets, such as: Improving our ability to promptly take a stance, Increasing transparency with respect to the impact of communications, and Expanding direct public communications.To illustrate the point further, I will now outline the two measures and corresponding indicators that have been assigned to our target of expanding direct public communications. These are first, setting up and maintaining up-to-date webpages for the public, with the indicator being the number of website visits, and second, holding an open day, with the indicator being an evaluation of the open day - for example by analysing visitor numbers, evaluating the media response or interviewing visitors.Only when the strategy has been fleshed out with indicators down to the operational level will it be possible to effect its implementation. If this does not occur, there is a serious risk that the strategy will simply be filed away and forgotten.The operational implementation I have just described falls under the responsibility of Controlling. On the other hand, as I have already pointed out, it is quite clearly the task of senior management to practise open communication so as to ensure that the strategy is firmly anchored across the organisation.Based on my experience, the importance of this cannot be overstated. With every step we take, we are constantly reminded of the need to make the case for our plans and projects. We need to convince our employees of the merits of our strategy and make the case to the public of the importance of price stability; target-based management and confidence in the euro are additional areas where we must win over support - and I am sure that you could continue this list with any number of examples from your authorities.I have set myself the personal objective of creating a culture of openness at the Bundesbank - both within the bank and in relation to the outside world. For many in the Bank, this means changing one's mindset. But it is most often people outside the Bank who continue to perceive it as a rather closed institution. They often see the Bundesbank as a fortress, with the grey, austere-looking building at our Central Office certainly contributing to this image. David Marsh once wrote that the way the Bundesbank operates and the sort of people running it are things that people rarely hear about. Let me assure you that there is nothing secretive about the Bank's work or its way of thinking. This is something I want to really spell out through my actions and words.The culture of openness is an important new area of focus for the controlling department; a conclusion also reached by the Management and Controlling in Public Institutions working group. With this in mind, I would like to wish the working group continued success in the important work it is carrying out.Ladies and gentlemen, I am now coming to the end of my remarks. We have all been aware for some time of the need to manage in a target-based way. The necessary concepts and instruments are at our disposal. Controlling departments are increasingly ready to work in partnership with decision-makers. They don't want to merely provide data and information and be written off as number crunchers or nit-pickers. They want to advise.It is now up to us to get our institutions on track and ensure that we continually improve our target-based management. To this end, we need suitable processes. And this requires leadership at the top and much effort in winning over people's hearts and minds. I am convinced that if we want our institutions to be able to hold their own in future then we have no choice but to pursue a target-based management approach.",2014-09-29,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-09-29,"Berlin","Germany","Spitzengespräch ""Zielorientierte Steuerung in der deutschen Verwaltung""","Forging strategic plans without a crystal ball - The importance of target-based management within the German authorities …",3996,19.6,5,44.8,11.7,"EN"
"2014-09-30 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","ich freue mich, heute beim Bankenabend in Leipzig zu Ihnen zu sprechen und danke Ihnen, Herr Benedikt, für die Einladung. Banken und Unternehmen - füreinander oder gegeneinander?, dieser Fragestellung werde ich mich im Folgenden widmen. Ich hoffe, dass die wenigsten von Ihnen dieselben Erfahrungen wie Mark Twain gemacht haben, der gesagt hat: Banker sind Menschen, die Dir bei gutem Wetter einen Regenschirm leihen, ihn aber zurückfordern, sobald es zu regnen beginnt.Gerade hier muss ich wohl nicht betonen, dass Banker natürlich nicht solche Menschen sind - zumindest die meisten. Im Gegenteil: Banken spielen eine wichtige Rolle für Unternehmen und für die gesamte Volkswirtschaft. Sie vermitteln zwischen jenen, die Kapital haben, und jenen, die es brauchen. Sie finanzieren Investitionen, wickeln den Zahlungsverkehr ab und begleiten Unternehmen bei Börsengängen. Umgekehrt darf man die andere Seite des Füreinander, die Unternehmen, nicht vergessen: Banken brauchen Unternehmen, um in Form von Krediten ihre Einlagen sinnvoll anzulegen und Erträge zu erwirtschaften.Ich übertreibe sicher nicht, wenn ich sage, dass dieses Füreinander von Banken und Unternehmen in Deutschland überwiegend gut funktioniert. Insbesondere für den deutschen Mittelstand hat das traditionelle Hausbankprinzip eine große Bedeutung. Viele Unternehmen arbeiten mit nur einem Kreditinstitut eng zusammen - bei der Kreditaufnahme, der Geldanlage und dem Zahlungsverkehr mit dem In- und Ausland.Allerdings hat die Finanzkrise das Verhältnis von Banken und Unternehmen ein Stück weit getrübt. Sie hat das Ansehen der Banken stark beschädigt und Bonmots wie das von Mark Twain wieder salonfähig gemacht. Der Vertrauensverlust ging so weit, dass in der Krise einige Unternehmen direkt bei der Bundesbank angefragt haben, ob sie bei uns ein Konto eröffnen könnten, weil sie den Geschäftsbanken nicht mehr trauen würden.Ohne Frage hat die Finanzkrise zum schwersten Wirtschaftseinbruch der Nachkriegszeit geführt und deutliche Schäden in der Realwirtschaft hinterlassen. Statt des Zusammenspiels aus Banken und Unternehmen waren plötzlich staatliche Rettungsschirme notwendig, ohne die alle Beteiligten ziemlich nass geworden wären.Meine Damen und Herren, die Finanzkrise und die anschließende globale Wirtschaftskrise haben gezeigt, wie eng das Finanzsystem und die Realwirtschaft miteinander verwoben sind. Auch wenn ein vollständiger Zusammenbruch des Finanzsystems verhindert werden konnte, sind viele Banken in Schieflagen geraten, darunter auch deutsche Institute. Die Finanzkrise hat uns vor Augen geführt, dass umfassende Reformen nötig sind, um ein stabileres Finanzsystem zu schaffen, das zuverlässig seinen eigentlichen Zweck für die Realwirtschaft erfüllen kann.Und so haben wir in den vergangenen Jahren eine wahre Flut an neuen Regulierungsinitiativen erlebt. Bei vielen Projekten befinden wir uns heute, sechs Jahre nach Beginn der Finanzkrise, auf der Zielgeraden, bei anderen liegt noch ein Stück Weg vor uns. Hierzu gehört vor allem das so genannte Too big to fail-Problem, also die Frage, wie wir mit Banken umgehen sollen, die so groß sind, dass ihr Scheitern das gesamte Finanzsystem in Schieflage bringen kann. Hier brauchen wir grenzüberschreitende Lösungen, weil große Banken in der Regel auch international aktiv sind.Die G-20-Staaten haben als Reaktion auf die Finanzkrise gefordert, die Widerstandsfähigkeit der einzelnen Banken zu stärken. Wird die einzelne Bank als quasi kleinster Baustein des Finanzsystems gestärkt, wird auch das System an sich gestärkt. Mit diesem Ziel vor Augen hat der Baseler Ausschuss für Bankenaufsicht 2010 einen Regulierungsrahmen verabschiedet, der unter dem Schlagwort Basel III firmiert. In diesem Rahmenwerk wurden in erster Linie die Anforderungen an das Eigenkapital überarbeitet. Eigenkapital ist entscheidend für die Stabilität der Banken, denn es ist der wichtigste Puffer, den sie haben, um Verluste aufzufangen. Nach den neuen Regeln müssen Banken nicht nur mehr Eigenkapital halten, es muss auch höherwertiger sein. Ab dem Jahr 2019 müssen Banken insgesamt eine Mindestquote von 7 Prozent hartem Kernkapital erfüllen - gegenüber den 2 Prozent, die bis Ende 2013 galten, ist das eine deutliche Steigerung.Und wenn wir auf die aktuellen Zahlen schauen, sehen wir, dass viele deutsche Banken die neuen Quoten bereits erfüllen. In einer regelmäßigen Untersuchung beobachten wir insgesamt 44 Institute. Diese haben im Mittel die Zielquote von 7 Prozent für das harte Kernkapital bereits überschritten. Die acht großen deutschen Institute liegen mit einer mittleren harten Kernkapitalquote von 9,4 Prozent deutlich oberhalb der Zielquote. Die übrigen, kleineren Banken stehen sogar noch besser da. Sie weisen im Mittel bereits eine Quote von 13,4 Prozent aus. Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Banken bereits viel getan haben, um die Anforderungen der neuen Regulierung zu erfüllen.Die neuen Regeln sollen dazu beitragen, das Bankensystem stabiler zu machen. Gleichzeitig aber sind die neuen Regeln natürlich ein Kostenfaktor für die Banken. Und hier gibt es einige Beobachter, die einen Nachteil für die Realwirtschaft befürchten. Sie argumentieren, dass die neuen Regeln die Kreditvergabe für die Banken teurer machen würden. Entsprechend ist die Sorge, dass die Banken weniger Kredite vergeben.Dem Baseler Ausschuss war durchaus bewusst, welche Auswirkungen die neuen Regeln haben können. Aus diesem Grund hat er Übergangsfristen festgelegt, die den Banken die notwendigen Anpassungen erleichtern sollen. Diese betreffen sowohl die qualitativen als auch die quantitativen Aspekte der neuen Eigenkapitalvorschriften. So werden beispielsweise die nicht mehr anerkannten Kapitalinstrumente nicht sofort, sondern über mehrere Jahre hinweg allmählich aus dem Eigenkapital herausgerechnet. Auch die steigenden Anforderungen an die Höhe des Eigenkapitals werden schrittweise eingeführt.Allerdings wurde der Baseler Ausschuss für diese Übergangsfristen auch kritisiert - einigen Regierungsvertretern und Marktbeobachtern schienen sie ein zu großes Zugeständnis an die Banken zu sein. Ich persönlich bin jedoch überzeugt davon, dass der Baseler Ausschuss hier den Interessen der Realwirtschaft Rechnung trägt, ohne dass er Abstriche bei der Erhöhung der Widerstandsfähigkeit des Bankensystems macht.Und natürlich wurde die Entwicklung von Basel III von Auswirkungsstudien begleitet, mit denen die Effekte der neuen Regeln auf die Banken und die Realwirtschaft gemessen wurden. Diese Studien kamen zu dem Schluss, dass die kurzfristigen Auswirkungen auf die Realwirtschaft eher gering seien. Und wenn wir in die Zukunft schauen, fördert die strengere Regulierung sogar den Wohlstand. Der Grund: Sie macht Finanzkrisen unwahrscheinlicher. Und das ist ein wichtiger Punkt. Wenn wir über die Kosten der Regulierung für die Banken reden, müssen wir auch über die Kosten von Krisen für die Bürger reden. In dieser Rechnung scheint mir der Preis, den wir für eine strengere Regulierung zahlen, durchaus angemessen. Trotzdem müssen die Auswirkungen von Reformen auf die Realwirtschaft natürlich immer berücksichtigt werden.Im Übrigen versucht die Regulierung, solchen Unternehmen entgegenzukommen, die auf Bankkredite angewiesen sind. Ich denke hier zum Beispiel an das sogenannte Mittelstandspaket des Baseler Rahmenwerks, das bereits mit Basel II eingeführt und in Basel III fortgeschrieben wurde. Dort wird die Kapitalunterlegung von Krediten an kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen je nach Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit und Besicherung um bis zur Hälfte abgesenkt. Damit werden die Eigenkapitalkosten für Kredite an kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen im Vergleich zur Kreditvergabe an größere Unternehmen deutlich günstiger.Das Mittelstandspaket des Baseler Rahmenwerks schafft deutliche Anreize für das Kreditgeschäft mit dem Mittelstand. Hier ist es uns mit der Regulierung, so denke ich, gelungen, das Verhältnis von Banken und Unternehmen positiv zu beeinflussen.Meine Damen und Herren, während Banken die Unternehmen finanzieren, brauchen sie ihrerseits die Unternehmen, um Erträge zu generieren. Ich bin der festen Überzeugung, dass dieses Füreinander in Deutschland sehr gut funktioniert. Die Finanzkrise hat aber auch gezeigt, dass aus dem Füreinander sehr schnell ein Gegeneinander werden kann. Dann nämlich, wenn einzelne Banken Geschäfte betreiben, deren Nutzen für die Realwirtschaft eher begrenzt ist, und unter deren Auswüchsen am Ende alle leiden. Die Unternehmen leiden, wenn eine Krise des Finanzsystems zu einer Wirtschaftskrise wird. Die Steuerzahler leiden, wenn der Staat Banken retten muss, die in Schieflage geraten sind. Und die Banken leiden, wenn als Folge einer Krise ihr Ruf leidet und Unternehmen wie Bürger ihnen das Vertrauen entziehen. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es entscheidend, dass die Banken sich auf ihre eigentliche Rolle besinnen: die Finanzierung der Realwirtschaft.Wie kann nun die Zukunft für das Verhältnis von Banken und Unternehmen aussehen? Ich bin zuversichtlich, dass das Füreinander weiterhin von großer Bedeutung sein wird. Insbesondere für den Mittelstand hat das Verhältnis zur Hausbank nach wie vor eine große Bedeutung. Auf Grund der Größe und der Rechtsform der mittelständischen Unternehmen ist eine Mittelbeschaffung über den Kapitalmarkt für sie nach wie vor schwierig. Dennoch bilden sich auch hier alternative Finanzierungsformen wie etwa die Mittelstandsanleihen als relativ neues Kapitalinstrument.Betrachtet man die Kapitalstruktur deutscher Unternehmen sieht man Folgendes: Im Jahr 1999 machte der Bankkredit noch 22 Prozent der Passivseite aus, im ersten Quartal 2014 waren es nur noch 15 Prozent. Ursache dafür ist vorrangig die mangelnde Nachfrage nach Krediten. Zum einen liegt das aktuell sicherlich an der Unsicherheit der Unternehmen mit Blick auf die Situation im Euro-Raum oder mit Blick auf die Situation in der Ukraine. Zum anderen haben viele Unternehmen in der Finanzkrise erlebt, dass sich Banken teilweise schlagartig aus der Finanzierung zurückgezogen haben. Daher haben sich die Unternehmen auf die Suche nach Alternativen zum Bankkredit gemacht und sich in Richtung des Kapitalmarktes orientiert. Dennoch ist das Ausmaß der Kapitalmarktfinanzierung in Deutschland immer noch gering - vor allem im Vergleich zu den USA oder Großbritannien.Neben der marktbasierten Finanzierung treten an die Stelle des klassischen Bankkredits aber auch zunehmend andere Kreditgeber wie etwa Versicherungen, sonstige Finanzinstitute oder Handelskredite von anderen Unternehmen. Auch hat die Finanzierung aus Eigenmitteln zugenommen, vor allem bei den Mittelständlern. Kurzum, die Finanzierung der deutschen Unternehmen wird bunter.Hier könnte man jetzt befürchten, dass sich diese Entwicklung negativ auf die Erträge der Banken auswirkt. An diesem Punkt will ich jedoch etwas relativieren. Eine Diversifizierung von Finanzierungsquellen kann durchaus zur Stabilität und zur Effizienz des Finanzsystems beitragen - und das nützt auch den Banken. Gerade in Deutschland, aber auch in Europa, haben wir hier im Vergleich zu den angelsächsischen Ländern noch viel Potenzial. Deswegen sehe ich die gestiegene Bedeutung von Anleihen, Verbriefungen und Schuldscheinen auch im Mittelstandssektor durchaus positiv. Allerdings ist es gerade in so einem jungen Marktsegment sehr wichtig, auf die Qualität der Instrumente zu achten. So ist auch die Mittelstandsanleihe kein Ausweg aus den Finanzierungsproblemen schwacher Unternehmen, sondern ein geeignetes Finanzierungsinstrument für größere und bonitätsstarke Mittelständler.Meine Damen und Herren, Banken und Unternehmen sind eng miteinander verwoben. Sie spielen jeder für sich, aber auch gemeinsam, eine wichtige Rolle für das Funktionieren einer Volkswirtschaft.Dabei prägen Banken und Unternehmen ihr Verhältnis ein ganzes Stück weit selbst: Banken entscheiden, an welche Unternehmen sie Kredite zu welchen Konditionen vergeben. Unternehmen erwidern dieses Vertrauen der Banken, indem sie die Kredite nachfragen. Dieses Verhältnis wird sich in den kommenden Jahren sicherlich weiter verändern und zusätzliche Akteure, vor allem auf dem Kapitalmarkt, mit einbeziehen. Ich halte das für eine positive Entwicklung, denn der nächste Regenschauer kommt bestimmt. Und dann ist es gut, wenn die Unternehmen sich ihre Schirme auch auf dem Kapitalmarkt beschaffen können.",2014-09-30,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-09-30,"Leipzig","Germany","Bankenabend in der Hauptverwaltung Sachsen und Thüringen","Banken und Unternehmen - Füreinander oder gegeneinander?",1742,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DE"
"2014-10-01 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","It is a pleasure for me to welcome you to this year's Bundesbank autumn conference. In my view, the topic of this conference is well chosen. The crisis and the great uncertainties it has brought on have made the pursuit of financial stability all the more urgent. For this reason I am delighted that so many of you have been able to accept the Bundesbank's invitation to discuss this sensitive issue.This evening I would like to take a closer look, with you, at the long-term challenges facing German credit institutions.With more than 1,800 institutions, the German financial system is the largest - in terms of sheer numbers - in the euro area. This large number reflects a special feature of the German banking system, namely that it is built on three pillars. Alongside the private banks, many regional savings banks and credit cooperatives are in operation. In the crisis, these locally important institutions played a major part in stabilising the German economy, because they were less strongly affected by the financial crisis thanks to their traditional business model.Nonetheless, all banks have felt the effects of a great loss of confidence since the financial crisis erupted in 2008 - they have lost the confidence of the general public, of trade and industry and of the interbank community. There are two major reasons for this loss of confidence. The first is uncertainty about how sound individual institutions actually are. The second relates to wrong investment advice in connection with securitisation products and certificates. More recently, confidence suffered again as information about banks' misconduct came to light - for example, the manipulation of reference rates such as Euribor and Libor or the legal violations that have often garnered so much attention from the media.The financial crisis and the subsequent loss of confidence have given rise to a major reform of financial regulation. Basel III is certainly the best known and most important of the measures designed to make banks more resilient by strengthening their capital and liquidity position. And many banks have indeed strengthened their capital position significantly over the past years. This elevated robustness is indispensable, as it was never possible at any point in the past to identify the specific causes of the next crisis in good time.This means that, in future, institutions will also have to be prepared for hitherto unknown dangers, uncertainties we may not even know exist. And here, a strong capital position is the best buffer against shocks, regardless of where they come from.However, dealing with unknown dangers requires German banks to embrace a new risk culture. The crisis made us painfully aware of just how far removed from a sound culture of risk the risk culture was at many banks in Germany.One reason for an inadequate risk culture lies in the too big to fail problem, which was a central issue in the last crisis. The failure of banks that are very large or strongly interconnected might endanger the whole financial system - the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 was a case in point. Thus, in the eyes of the markets these banks enjoy an implicit state guarantee: in case of trouble, the state would feel compelled to step in and rescue the distressed bank.Yet this implicit state guarantee creates flawed - and dangerous - incentives. If a bank can be sure of state support when it gets into difficulties, it will no longer see risk and return as being two sides of the same coin. Essentially, this means that profits from risky business operations remain with the bank, while the taxpayer is left to shoulder potential losses: this is an unjustifiable scenario.For this reason, I believe that an important signal to the market and to banks is to develop mechanisms that allow even big banks to fail without destabilising the entire financial system. The possibility of a market exit, which is fundamental to any market economy, must also exist for the banking sector. The real threat of actually failing is in itself a strong incentive for banks to be more aware of risk in their actions. The long-term goal, then, must be to put risk and return back onto the same page.One important step towards that goal is the European resolution mechanism which will start in 2016. This mechanism ensures that the owners and creditors of banks are the first in line when it comes to bearing losses. Consequently, the taxpayer will be the last in line to foot the bill. This realigns risks and rewards and will certainly have a fundamental and positive effect on the risk culture within banks.Yet what is crucial here is not only that rules are in place for dealing with a distressed bank, but that banks don't get into financial dire straits in the first place. Banks have to improve their risk culture regardless of the “too big to fail” problem. At the spring meeting of the Financial Stability Board, recommendations for action were agreed on and subsequently announced. According to the Financial Stability Board, the foundational elements of a sound risk culture are effective risk governance, an effective risk appetite framework and, in particular, the alignment of compensation with prudent risk taking.Four practices may help in assessing the soundness of a risk culture. First, the tone from the top: the board and senior management are the starting point for setting the financial institution's core values and the expectations for its risk culture, and their behaviour must reflect the values being espoused. Second, accountability: employees must understand the institution's core values and its approach to risk. And they have to be aware that they are responsible for their actions and risk taking. Third, effective communication and challenge: a sound risk culture promotes an environment of open communication and effective challenge, within which decision-making processes encourage a range of views. Last but not least, incentives: performance and talent management encourage and reinforce maintenance of the financial institution's desired risk management behaviour. This includes changing the banks' in-house incentive schemes. One example here would be to cap bonus payments and link them to the long-term development of institutions' profits.We must succeed in embedding awareness of sustainable business practices more firmly in the risk culture of banks.Of course, a new risk culture has its price, which will unquestionably also have a short-term impact on the banks' profitability. What's more, the current low-interest-rate environment also remains a major challenge for the profitability of banks. German savings banks and credit cooperatives in particular rely on net interest income as the most important earnings component. Consequently, they expect a further decline in profitability in the current interest rate environment.In addition, competitive pressure is high due to the sheer number of institutions in the marketplace, and this will no doubt increase as the integration of the banking market across Europe deepens.Last but not least, the implementation of the new banking rules will come at a cost - to raise fresh capital, say, or to draw up recovery plans and build up a restructuring fund.Against this backdrop, it is essential that German credit institutions recognise their weaknesses and counteract them at an early stage. This could be achieved by boosting income in fee and commission business and by taking into consideration cost-cutting measures. There is traditionally a strong branch network in Germany. Streamlining this could reduce costs. Mergers could also make sense for several credit institutions, with the focus in each case being on the sustainability of each business model.Ladies and gentlemenIn my speech, I have discussed three challenges that German banks currently face: regulatory reform, necessary changes in risk culture and low profitability.Regulatory reform definitely comes at a cost for the banks. However, when we talk about the cost of regulation for the banks, we also need to talk about the cost of crises for the general public. Viewed from this perspective, I think the price we are paying for stricter regulation is entirely appropriate. Even for the banks themselves, the rising outlay for regulatory matters is not only a cost factor. They, too, benefit from a stable financial system.The same is true of a change in risk culture. There is evidence that institutions inadequately identified and managed not just their market and credit risks but their operational risks as well: it is therefore imperative that improvements be made. Credit institutions have themselves already announced their intention to change their risk culture. However, this fundamental decision is not one that should be merely voiced at the senior management level. The banks must do more than simply talk the talk: their new values must be practised institution-wide by managers and employees alike.In conclusion, each institution faces the major challenges of adjusting to new regulatory requirements and of improving its risk culture without completely losing sight of profitability, particularly as profitability is already challenged by the current environment of low interest rates and fierce competition in the German banking market.However, I am confident that German credit institutions will succeed in overcoming the challenges ahead and in finding a healthy balance between risk and reward. The first steps to achieving these goals have already been taken.",2014-10-01,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-10-01,"Berlin","Germany","Bundesbank's Autumn Conference","Long-term challenges facing banks in Germany",1530,20.6,5.1,43.2,12.3,"EN"
"2014-10-02 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for inviting me to the Handelshochschule in Leipzig. It is a pleasure to be here.First of all, let me tell you a short story I heard the other day. A young banker decided to get his first tailor-made suit. As he tried it on, he reached down to put his hands in the pockets but, to his surprise, found none. He mentioned this to the tailor, who asked him, You're a banker, right?. The young man answered, Yes, I am., to which the tailor replied, Well, whoever heard of a banker putting his hand in his own pocket?.It is certainly true that the reputation of bankers has suffered during the crisis. But still, banks and savings institutions play a vital role in any modern economy and, indeed, in our everyday lives. We simply could not manage without them. Entrepreneurs, bankers and individuals alike: we all benefit from a stable banking and financial system. Financial stability is therefore a public good, not just nationally but on a global scale, too. At the same time, banking can sometimes be associated with external effects. It doesn't just affect banks and their business associates; it also has an impact on third parties with no stake in the game. And during the financial crisis, those third parties were the taxpayers.Regulators and supervisors can rectify a market failure of this kind, and it is in the public interest for them to do just that. It isn't a question of whether but of how to regulate. And it is this matter of how to regulate that I would like to discuss now - not by focusing on specific legal provisions, but by outlining certain principles which I consider particularly important.What is the job of regulators? Well, in a nutshell, their job is to create a framework that allows market forces to produce efficient outcomes while also preventing instability and crises. Yet it is vital to ensure that this framework is not overly rigid; we should not confuse stagnation with stability. The financial system is in constant flux, and regulation has to keep pace with it. The regulatory framework therefore needs to be just as adaptable as the financial system itself - this is the first principle on my list.It is now widely accepted that innovations rarely make the financial system simpler and usually make it more complex. The key financial innovation in the ancient Phoenician civilisation was the forward transaction - a financial instrument that every student of financial economics is familiar with today. Since then, financial innovations have become increasingly complex - to the point where the instruments used today are often understood by only a handful of experts.But does that mean that we need increasingly complex regulation, too? Or could it be that we need only a few simple rules to ensure effective supervision and safeguard financial stability?One current example of this debate concerning simple and complex regulation is the leverage ratio. The advocates of a simple leverage ratio for banks want to replace the current risk-based capital rules with a blanket capital requirement. They believe that the same percentage of capital should be held against all assets, regardless of their risk. I have to admit that the idea appears appealingly simple at first sight. And it would avoid the mistakes and manipulation that can arise during the complex process of calculating risk weights.Yet a leverage ratio would also create the wrong incentives. If banks had to hold the same percentage of capital against all assets, any institution wanting to maximise its profits would probably invest in high-risk assets, as they produce particularly high returns. This would eradicate the corrective influence of capital cover in reducing risk.Weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of simple and complex regulation, it is probably better in this instance to use risk weightings in combination with the leverage ratio - which is precisely what the new rules envisage. Consequently, the second principle of good regulation is that regulation must be as simple as possible and as complex as necessary.Yet sometimes a certain set of circumstances can make regulation needlessly complex. One example of this is again the leverage ratio. The calculation of this ratio, which is essentially quite simple, is complicated by the fact that accounting standards vary from country to country. Intricate conversion calculations are needed to make leverage ratios based on US accounting principles comparable to those based on the standards used in Europe. If accounting standards were harmonised at a global level, the applicable regulation would be simpler.However, the more complex the regulation, the more important it is to adhere to the third principle on my list: coherence. I believe that regulation must be coherent on at least three levels.First, regulation has to be coherent across borders and regions. We have a global financial system, and it therefore requires global regulation. Where regulation varies from country to country, there is a danger of regulatory arbitrage - of banks moving their business to countries with the lightest-touch regulation. The problem with this behaviour is that the risks stemming from these transactions could potentially affect the entire financial system. This is why the G20 have made the issue of financial market regulation a priority. In cooperation with the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, they are working to develop a coherent regulatory framework at the global level. Even so, I'm concerned to see that some countries outside Europe are adopting their own regulatory initiatives which breach the principle of cross-border coherence. I believe that the danger of banking regulation one day returning to the principle of every man for himself needs to be taken seriously.Yet regulation not only needs to be coherent across borders and regions but also across different sectors. Here, too, the central issue is the danger of regulatory arbitrage. One current example is the growth of the shadow banking industry, where financial enterprises conduct business which creates bank-like risks but is either regulated insufficiently or not at all. In many cases, these risks are not even recorded. Yet the shadow banking industry may become a source of systemic risk. We therefore need to expand the regulatory framework in this area to ensure that it is coherent.Third, it goes without saying that the content of regulation also needs to be coherent. The capital rules are a case in point. Unlike for all other forms of credit, banks do not have to hold capital against government bonds in line with the risks that they carry, and this inconsistency has dangerous side-effects. Since the euro-area sovereign debt crisis - if not before - it has become clear that government bonds are anything but risk-free. In this area too, we should work to restore the coherence of regulation in the medium term.As crucial as coherence is, however, regulation also has to be guided by a fourth principle: proportionality. It is appropriate to apply strict regulation to large institutions which are closely interconnected within the financial system. Equally, however, we must take care not to overburden small and medium-sized institutions; they should be governed by simpler regulation. The standardised approaches applied in supervision and de minimis thresholds such as those used in reporting can help us to achieve this proportionality.Ladies and gentlemen, I've outlined four different principles for ensuring good regulation. First, regulation has to be flexible and able to keep pace with developments in the financial system. Second, regulation must be as simple as possible and as complex as necessary. Third, regulation has to be coherent in terms of its content, as well as across borders, regions and sectors. Fourth, regulation must be guided by the principle of proportionality.Abiding by these principles will not, of course, allow us to solve every single regulatory problem. Yet they do provide us with a yardstick for assessing regulatory provisions. And I believe that is very valuable in our quest for stability.All in all, though, even the best regulation is useless if nobody is overseeing compliance. And that is precisely the job of supervisors. Supervisors have to make sure that, in the banks' search for profit, they follow the rules and do not lose sight of the public interest.Do supervisors have to be the better bankers? No, absolutely not. Business decisions must be left to those being paid to make them. However, supervisors have to know - and understand - how banking works. Against this background, I personally would very much welcome an increase in the migration of staff between the banking industry and the supervisory agencies.In 2010, the IMF published a paper entitled: The Making of Good Supervision: Learning to Say No. This idea of saying no refers to the fact that good supervisors must have the will to act. This means that they must always remain aware of their true objective: to uphold the public interest. They must not allow themselves to succumb to a sort of Stockholm Syndrome for supervisors and confuse the public good with that of the supervised banks.Nevertheless, supervisors must not only be willing but also able to act. Let me give you an example. It certainly isn't the job of supervisors to keep each and every bank in business. In a market economy, it has to be possible for banks without a workable business model to fail. However, if banks are very large or interconnected, their failure might disrupt the whole system - they become too big to fail. The ability of supervisors to resolve the bank in question is then very limited. In fact, the authorities might be forced to bail out the bank with taxpayer funds in order to prevent a systemic meltdown.Regulators therefore have to create a framework that gives supervisors the ability to act. They must be able to resolve or restructure a failing bank - however large, interconnected or significant it may be. Over the past few years we have made some progress toward this objective. In Europe, a resolution mechanism for banks will be in place from the beginning of 2016. However, we also have to address the too big to fail problem at the global level. We have taken some small steps towards this goal but we still have a big leap ahead of us. I therefore consider the too big to fail problem largely unresolved.But let's return to the issue of good banking supervision. Good supervisors need both the will and the ability to act. My example illustrates how the ability to act depends on the regulatory framework. But there is more. Both the will and the ability to act also depend on the institutional set-up of banking supervision.And in this area, Europe is on the eve of a major change. One month from now, banking supervision in Europe will be transferred from the national to the European level. On 4 November, the ECB will take on the direct supervision of the largest 120 banks in the euro area. These banks account for more than 80  percent of the aggregated balance sheet for the euro-area banking sector. This will make the ECB one of the world's largest supervisors.European-level supervision is the most important step towards financial market integration in the euro area since the launch of our single currency. It is a logical step, too, since a single monetary policy also requires integrated financial markets - which includes, without doubt, European-level supervision.European banking supervision will allow banks throughout the euro area to be supervised according to the same high standards. In addition, cross-border effects can be covered better through joint supervision than by national supervisors. And adding a European perspective to the national view will put more distance between the supervisory authority and the entities it supervises. This will minimise the danger of supervisors getting all-too-close to their banks and thus treating them with kid gloves out of national interest.European banking supervision will thus enhance the effectiveness of banking supervision. And, together with the European resolution mechanism for banks, it will definitely help to increase the stability of the financial system.Ladies and gentlemen, the French writer François Fénelon once claimed that, the more you say, the less people remember. As this obviously isn't my aim, I would like to conclude my remarks by taking a peek into the future.The past history of regulation has been one of constant ups and downs. Periods of deregulation have usually been followed by a crisis, then followed by a period of re-regulation, and again by a period of deregulation. It is precisely in phases of re-regulation that banks tend to complain about the time and money it costs - and the present period is no exception. But are we really overregulating? If we look at the benefits to society of a stable banking system and the social costs of a banking crisis, I believe the costs of regulation are justifiable.However, for the future I would like regulation to evolve somewhat more steadily and adapt more quickly to new challenges: the low-interest-rate phase, high-frequency trading, charges of manipulating the LIBOR or the setting of forex rates and gold prices, to name just a few examples. We should not wait until the aftermath of the next crisis to come up with ways of responding to these challenges.I do not believe, however, that regulators and supervisors are all-knowing and all-powerful. The bankers are just as responsible as the supervisors and regulators. I am well aware that the number of bad apples among bankers is very small. However, their behaviour causes everybody to suffer: the public, when a crisis breaks out, and the bankers, when the public tar them all with the same brush.Yet we should be aware that the value of the financial system is measurable against one key criterion: its reliability as a service provider to the real economy. Financial transactions are not an end in themselves. If we can instil this idea in people's minds, we'll be able to take the final key step in our quest for greater stability.",2014-10-02,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-10-02,"Leipzig","Germany","Handelshochschule Leipzig","The quest for stability - Regulating and supervising banks",2340,17.2,4.9,47,10.8,"EN"
"2014-10-08 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for having me here today. It is a privilege to speak at an institution as distinguished as Brookings. For almost a century now, this institute has provided essential analytical input for the work of policymakers around the world. Naturally, this includes central banks such as the Bundesbank.And it is at the Bundesbank that my speech begins. Allow me to bring up my very first week in office - a week I still remember vividly. Naturally, it was a decisive week for me, but even more important, it was a decisive week for the euro area. My first day of work was on 3 May 2010.On the day before, on 2 May 2010, the EU finance ministers had agreed to support stumbling Greece with a €110 billion rescue package. One week later, on 10 May 2010, the ECB decided to buy government bonds in order to stabilise the financial markets - a decision which the Bundesbank has criticised.Looking back, no one can deny that this first week of May 2010 was a turbulent one. To many, it even counts as the “official” start of the euro crisis. To me, it was a time when two things became obvious.First, many observers from outside Europe - notably from the US- underestimated the political will in Europe to hold the euro area together. Second, many observers from inside Europe - including myself - overestimated the stability of the euro area's institutional framework.What is the logical conclusion of these two insights? The conclusion is that we have to take advantage of the apparent political will in order to improve the euro area's institutional framework. But how?In my view, the overarching theme in this regard is integration. To be sure, Europe's political landscape now features a number of parties that are riding a wave of euro-scepticism and anti-European rhetoric. This is a disturbing development. Nevertheless, political leaders and the majority of people throughout Europe are still very much convinced of the idea of a unified Europe.And from an economic point of view, deeper integration could help to strengthen the framework of the European monetary union. Let us take a look at three areas where further integration could be the way forward.The first area is public finances. And in order to understand the core of my argument, it is important to be familiar with the particular features of the European monetary union. The European monetary union is special in that it combines a single monetary policy with national fiscal policies.The monetary policy for the 18 countries of the euro area is decided by the Governing Council of the ECB in Frankfurt. However, the fiscal policies of the 18 euro-area member states are a matter for the national policymakers - each country decides on its own government revenues and expenditures.This imbalance of responsibilities gives individual countries an incentive to borrow - a “deficit bias” is built into the system. Our objective should be to counter that deficit bias to ensure a stable monetary union. This can only be achieved by realigning responsibilities - liability and control have to be in balance.And one way to rebalance liability and control is deeper integration. If we were to take this path, the European level would gain certain control rights over national budgets. This would amount to what is known as a fiscal union. However, such a step would depend on the countries of the euro area transferring national sovereignty to the European level - for example, by giving the European level the right to intervene in the event of unsound public finances.Giving up sovereignty in this way would be a radical change and require wide-ranging legislative changes nationally and at the European level. More than anything, such changes would need the support not only of policymakers but also of the general public. And on this point we need to be realistic. I cannot identify any willingness to do that at present - not in Germany or in any other country of the euro area.This means that, for the foreseeable future, control of fiscal policy in Europe will remain at the national level. Thus, in this area, deeper integration still lies beyond the horizon.But if the current state of lopsided integration prevails, the national level must assume liability for its policies. That would mean strengthening the current set of rules on borrowing: the Stability and Growth Pact. These rules have since been tightened - now they have to be applied and complied with.This framework is supplemented by a permanent crisis resolution mechanism: the European Stability Mechanism, or ESM in short, which was established in 2012. The objective of the ESM is to be able to counter severe risks to financial stability in the euro area. The effectiveness of the ESM is based on the idea of a strong deterrent: as long as markets believe the ESM to be powerful enough to act in a crisis, they have much less incentive to speculate against any euro-area country. This principle is now being called into question by an idea that the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has recently floated. He suggests using free ESM funds to finance investments in infrastructure. In my view, such a step would greatly reduce the effectiveness of the ESM.In a way, the discussion about liability and control relates to monetary policy. The Governing Council of the ECB recently decided to buy asset-backed securities. This decision represents a far-reaching change in the ECB's monetary policy: the objective is not just to boost lending, but also to directly pump money into  the economy.The effect of this measure would be to transfer credit risks taken by private banks to the central bank and, ultimately, to the taxpayer. Were this to take place even despite the lack of an adequate compensation for the risks, we would have another specific policy measure that increases the imbalance between liability and control: bank owners would not be responsible for their credit decisions, leaving taxpayers to once again foot the bill. This contradicts nearly all the G20 initiatives that are currently underway.Ladies and gentlemen, at this point in time, a fiscal union remains more of a vision than of a concrete step to be taken anytime soon. However, in another area, Europe is about to take a significant step towards deeper integration.Less than a month from today, the ECB will assume direct supervision of the 120 largest banks in the euro area - thereby erecting the first pillar of a European banking union. The 120 banks which will come under the supervision of the ECBaccount for more than 80 percent of the aggregated balance sheet for the euro-area banking sector. Thus, the ECB will become one of the world's largest supervisors.The banking union is certainly the biggest step towards financial integration in Europe since the launch of our common currency. And to me, it is the most logical step to take. Single monetary policy requires integrated financial markets - which includes, without doubt, European-level banking supervision.European banking supervision will allow banks throughout the euro area to be supervised according to the same high standards. In addition, cross-border effects can be covered better through joint supervision than by national supervisors. And adding a European perspective to the national view will put more distance between the supervisory authority and the entities it supervises. This will minimise the danger of supervisors getting all too close to their banks and thus treating them with “kid gloves” out of national interest.Meanwhile, a comprehensive banking union has to comprise more than just an effective European banking supervision. The second pillar of the banking union is a European resolution mechanism to deal with future bank failures. This mechanism will be in place from 2016 onwards. If push comes to shove and a bank is no longer viable, shareholders and creditors will be first in line to bear banks' losses, and taxpayers' money will only be the very last resort. Thus, the European resolution mechanism will also contribute to disentangling the close connection between banks and public finances, which was a central problem in the euro crisis.However, one thing should be clear: regulation will not solve all of our problems. The banks themselves have to adapt to the challenges they face. One of these challenges is profitability. Given the costs of stricter regulation and the prevailing low-interest-rate environment, remaining profitable poses a challenge to many euro-area banks. Thus, it is essential that banks recognise their weaknesses and do something about them early on.Looking at German banks, this could be achieved by boosting income in fee and commission business and by looking into cost-cutting measures. There is traditionally a strong branch network in Germany. Streamlining it could reduce costs. Mergers might also make sense for some credit institutions, with the focus in each case being on the sustainability of each business model.In any case, the banking union is definitely a major step forward in designing a better framework for the European monetary union. However, we should broaden our view beyond the banking sector. A deeper integration of capital markets would also contribute to sharing opportunities and risks.To be sure, we have come a long way in integrating capital markets in Europe. According to statistics provided by the Bank for International Settlement, European banks' claims within Europe stood at 36 percent of GDP at the end of the 1990s. By 2008 the share had grown to 77 percent. This share has fallen during the crisis, but still stands at around 48 percent of GDP.However, there are two caveats regarding this trend of capital markets integration in Europe. First, the financing structure of European companies is still predominantly bank-based. A look at the balance sheets of German companies, for instance, shows that bank credit still accounts for about 15 percent of the liability side. This is certainly lower than the 22 percent observed at the end of the 1990s, but compared to the US or the UK there is still room to increase the share of capital market financing.Second, although banks' cross-border exposures have increased, capital market integration remains incomplete. In the banking sector, for instance integration has concentrated on the interbank market while credit markets for companies remain predominantly national. The integration of the markets for capital may have increased in Europe, but the ownership structures of many companies have not. They are still strongly national.The relatively low level of integration in European capital markets represents a barrier for risk sharing. Equity holdings in the US, for instance, are much more widely dispersed throughout the entire country. Thus, when a negative shock hits an industry or a specific region, the resulting losses are spread widely beyond that region. In Europe they are not, because equity holdings are much more concentrated nationally.Empirical studies for the United States show that integrated markets for capital cushion around 40 percent of the cyclical fluctuations between the US federal states. A share of around 25 percent is smoothed via the credit markets, while fiscal mechanisms cushion just 20 percent of shocks. Studies for Canada and Sweden come to similar conclusions.Against this backdrop, two general lines of action could be followed in Europe. First, it might be beneficial to increase the share of capital markets in the financing structure of companies. This would, of course, require a shift away from the traditional bank-based system to a certain degree. In this context, it might be worth taking a closer look at tax regimes, among other things. Currently, tax treatment still favours debt financing over equity financing. Removing this bias in taxation would encourage companies to strengthen their equity base and thus turn more towards capital markets in their search for sources of funds.On a side note: strengthening the equity base is also a central issue with regard to banks, as the crisis has shown. Nevertheless, strengthening the equity base of banks is less a question of providing the right incentives, but rather a question of outright regulatory requirements. And here, we have already come a long way.The second line of action would be to deepen the integration of capital markets, which might eventually result in the formation of a capital markets union. To be sure, the concept of a capital markets union is not as clear-cut as that of a banking union. Capital markets are complex and non-bank finance takes many forms: corporate bonds, private equity, public equity, venture capital or peer-to-peer lending, to name just a few. And integration not just relates to financial products but also to integral elements of the respective markets, such as stock exchanges and central counterparties. Thus, any attempt to form a capital markets union would require a lot of different measures in a lot of different areas.Nevertheless, the idea of a capital markets union has gained some traction lately. Among others, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, have promoted the concept of a capital markets union. To me, it would be a logical step to supplement the banking union with a capital markets union. It would reduce fragmentation in European financial markets and, at the same time, enhance their efficiency and stability. Thus, it is certainly a goal worth pursuing.Ladies and gentlemenGeorge Washington is credited with having written, more than two centuries ago in a letter to a friend, that a United States of Europe would come into being. This is certainly a bold vision which has been voiced repeatedly since the days of George Washington - by Winston Churchill and, more recently, the former Vice-President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding.The vision of a United States of Europe is a very broad approach aiming at an encompassing political integration. In my speech today, I have taken a more modest approach and argued from an economic point of view. I have highlighted three areas where deeper integration might help to enhance the stability of monetary union.The first area is public finances, although a fiscal union is currently a rather unrealistic vision. The second area is the banking system, and here we are on the eve of a major step towards integration - in November of this year, the banking union will become reality. The third area is capital markets. Looking to the future, I consider a capital markets union another project that would contribute to enhancing the stability of monetary union.In my view, integration is the way forward as long as it is balanced. Not all proposals for deeper integration that are currently being discussed fulfil this criterion. Take the example of eurobonds: in essence, eurobonds would provide a joint guarantee for individual sovereign debt. This step would increase the imbalance of integration I mentioned when I discussed the issue of a fiscal union. Thus, what we need are balanced steps of integration such as those I have described in my speech.To be sure, these are all big steps, but in my view they are worth taking. A stable monetary union will eventually benefit all member states, including Germany. This is a deep belief I hold, a belief that has even grown since my first week at the Bundesbank.",2014-10-08,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-10-08,"Washington DC","USA","Brookings Institute","Designing a stable monetary union - progress and open issues",2533,17.9,4.9,43.5,11.6,"EN"
"2014-10-09 - BuBa - Claudia Buch.txt","ich habe die Einladung nach München sehr gerne angenommen. In München habe ich zwei ausgesprochen produktive Forschungsaufenthalte am CES-ifo verbracht, mit vielen Kollegen an der Universität und den Forschungsinstituten bin ich in engem Kontakt. Und nicht zuletzt habe ich die Verleihung der Hans-Möller-Medaille, zu deren Anlass ich bereits im Jahr 2012 bei der Hauptverwaltung in München zu Gast sein durfte, noch in sehr guter Erinnerung.Mit München verbinde ich aber nicht nur gute Forschungsbedingungen, sondern natürlich auch die besondere Atmosphäre der Stadt – die ich auch jenseits von Biergärten, Braukultur und Oktoberfest immer sehr genieße. Daher erlauben Sie mir, dass ich heute nicht über Bier spreche, sondern die Frage stelle, was die Ziele makroprudenzieller Regulierung sind – und ob wir nicht nur alten Wein in neue Schläuche füllen.Mit meinem Vortrag stelle ich auf ein relativ neues Politikfeld ab, in dem die Bundesbank eine wichtige Rolle spielt – die makroprudenzielle Regulierung. Viele werden mit diesem Begriff auf den ersten Blick nicht viel anfangen können. Worum geht es also? Makroprudenzielle Regulierung hat das Ziel, das Finanzsystem stabiler zu machen. Finanzkrisen haben hohe Kosten für die Wirtschaft. Das Wachstum sinkt, die Staatsverschuldung steigt, und viele dieser negativen Effekte sind sehr dauerhaft. Das Finanzsystem stabiler zu machen und dafür zu sorgen, dass Finanzkrisen die Realwirtschaft nicht zu sehr in Mitleidenschaft ziehen, ist also eine wichtige politische Aufgabe.Die meisten wirtschaftspolitischen Themen, über die wir heute diskutieren, hat es in der ein oder anderen Form schon einmal gegeben. Das Politikfeld Finanzstabilität aber ist neu – zumindest gibt es ein explizites Mandat für diese Politik erst seit der Finanzkrise. Aber sind die Maßnahmen, die wir ergreifen können, wirklich so neu? Oder wird nicht bereits Bestehendes nur neu verpackt – füllen wir also alten Wein in neue Schläuche?Diese Gefahr besteht tatsächlich, wenn wir nicht sehr klar definieren, welche Ziele mit makroprudenziellen Maßnahmen erreicht werden sollen, welche konkreten Instrumente wir einsetzen wollen und wie wir die Effektivität dieser Instrumente überprüfen wollen. Denn wie wir das Ziel Finanzstabilität am besten erreichen, ist nicht von vorneherein klar. Und genau darüber möchte ich heute sprechen. Was sind die konkreten Ziele makroprudenzieller Maßnahmen? Und: Wie grenzt sich diese Politik von anderen Maßnahmen ab – vor allem von der traditionellen Bankenaufsicht, aber auch anderen Eingriffen in die Finanzmärkte wie Kapitalverkehrskontrollen?Es gibt in der Tat bewährte Maßnahmen, mit denen sich die Stabilität eines Finanzsystems erhöhen lässt. Wie beim Wein gibt es gute Jahrgänge, die die Zeiten überdauern. Aber es gibt auch Maßnahmen, die zwar in der Vergangenheit dazu beigetragen haben mögen, das Finanzsystem stabiler zu machen. Gleichzeitig haben diese Maßnahmen die Funktionsweise der Finanzmärkte zu weit eingeschränkt. Diese schlechten Weine sollten wir lieber nicht mehr einschenken.Aber lassen Sie mich zu meiner ersten Frage kommen:Am einfachsten lässt sich makroprudenzielle Regulierung erklären, indem man sie von der traditionellen Bankenaufsicht – der mikroprudenziellen Aufsicht –  abgrenzt. Die Bankenaufsicht kontrolliert die Einhaltung der gesetzlichen Spielregeln für Banken. Diese Spielregeln zielen auf die Stabilität jeder einzelnen Bank. Beispielsweise muss eine Bank ihre Kreditrisiken entsprechend bestimmter Vorgaben mit Eigenkapital absichern, um ihren Verpflichtungen gegenüber Fremdkapitalgebern auch im Falle eines Kreditausfalls nachkommen zu können. Durchgeführt wird die Aufsicht von der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) und der Bundesbank. Aber schon sehr bald, Anfang November, geht die Verantwortung auf die Europäische Zentralbank (EZB) über. Im Rahmen der Bankenunion werden dann Teams unter Leitung der EZB alle großen Banken der Eurozone direkt beaufsichtigen.Spätestens seit der Finanzkrise ist klar, dass die Stabilität der einzelnen Bank kein Garant für die Stabilität des gesamten Finanzsystems ist. Störungen auf Märkten oder bei Banken, die für relativ unbedeutend gehalten wurden, haben weite Teile des Finanzsystems in Schieflage gebracht.Warum konnte das passieren? Verantwortlich für solche systemischen Krisen sind Ansteckungseffekte. Diese Ansteckungseffekte können ganz direkt entstehen, weil es vertragliche Verpflichtungen zwischen Banken in Schieflage und Banken, die eigentlich solide sind, gibt. Über diese direkten Kanäle können Risiken übertragen werden und Probleme für das System insgesamt entstehen.Es gibt aber auch indirekte Ansteckungskanäle die, wie wir aus empirischen Untersuchungen wissen, oft noch bedeutender sind. Wenn Banken ähnliche Geschäftsmodelle haben oder wenn sie sich demselben gesamtwirtschaftlichen Risiko aussetzen, dann kann das gesamte System in Schieflage geraten. Eine Änderung der Rahmenbedingungen kann beispielsweise dazu führen, dass viele Banken gleichzeitig ihre Bilanz anpassen müssen. Es kann ein Teufelskreis entstehen aus einer Verschlechterung der Finanzierungsbedingungen, dem Versuch, Forderungen abzustoßen, daraus entstehenden Verlusten, und einem zu geringen Eigenkapital, um diese Verluste aufzufangen.Um einen solchen Teufelskreis zu verhindern, weitet der makroprudenzielle Ansatz den Fokus entsprechend aus: Ziel ist nicht die Stabilität einzelner Banken, sondern die Stabilität des Finanzsystems als Ganzes. Finanzstabilität soll gewährleisten, dass das Finanzsystem auch in Krisenzeiten seine volkswirtschaftlichen Funktionen erfüllt. Sparer sollten geeignete Anlagemöglichkeiten finden, und es sollten nur die Projekte finanziert werden, bei denen Ertrag und Risiko in einem angemessenen Verhältnis stehen. Außerdem muss der Zahlungsverkehr jederzeit reibungslos funktionieren, eine Funktion die gerade in Krisenzeiten nicht automatisch gewährleistet ist.Auch wenn es um die Stabilität des gesamten Finanzsystems geht, spielen Anforderungen an das Eigenkapital von Banken eine wichtige Rolle. Denn besser kapitalisierte Banken können Verluste besser auffangen. Es wird weniger wahrscheinlich, dass Krisen das gesamte System in Schieflage bringen. Dies ist ein Grund dafür, warum mehr Eigenkapital eine so zentrale Rolle für die Regulierung der Banken spielt.Aber neben Anforderungen an das Eigenkapital sind weitere Eingriffsmöglichkeiten denkbar. Finanzkrisen entstehen aus einer zu starken Verschuldung. Direkte Beschränkungen der Kreditvergabe von Banken oder konkrete Vorgaben zu den Standards der Kreditvergabe könnten das System also stabilisieren. Oder es könnten Eigenkapitalanforderungen danach gestaffelt werden, wie systemrelevant eine Bank tatsächlich ist. Und nicht zuletzt könnten Beschränkungen des freien Kapitalverkehrs ein Finanzsystem gegenüber Krisen im Ausland abschotten.Viele dieser Maßnahmen klingen vernünftig, aber gleichzeitig können auch unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen eintreten. Oder es können mit einer Maßnahme ganz andere Ziele angestrebt werden als das Ziel Finanzstabilität. Es muss also überprüft werden, welche Ziele eine Regulierung verfolgt und ob diese Ziele erreicht werden. Dazu brauchen wir klare Definitionen der Ziele, Transparenz bezüglich der Zielsetzung und Standards der Politikevaluation.Wirtschaftspolitische Eingriffe in die Finanzmärkte können unterschiedliche Ziele haben. Beschränkungen des freien Kapitalverkehrs sind oft eingesetzt worden, um eine von ausländischen Einflüssen unabhängige Geldpolitik durchführen zu können. Viele Eingriffe in die Tätigkeit von Banken – z.B. regionale Beschränkungen der Kreditvergabe oder Beschränkungen der Zinssetzung – haben sozial- oder regionalpolitische Ziele oder dienen dem Verbraucherschutz. Diese Maßnahmen können zwar die Finanzmärkte stabilisieren, sie können aber auch andere wichtige Funktionen der Finanzmärkte einschränken.Ein prominentes Bespiel sind Kapitalverkehrskontrollen, die nach der schweren Wirtschaftskrise der 20er und 30er Jahre des vergangenen Jahrhunderts eingeführt wurden. Einer Phase der Globalisierung der Finanzmärkte Ende des 19. und Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts folgte eine lange Phase der Abschottung der Märkte. Tatsächlich waren Finanzkrisen in dieser Zeit relativ selten. Gleichzeitig hat die Abschottung aber dazu geführt, dass in den einzelnen Ländern wenig Wettbewerb auf den Finanzmärkten herrschte und dass gerade die Insider Vorteile hatten. Dieser Trend wendete sich erst in den vergangenen 20 Jahren, als die Integration der Märkte sogar noch weit über das frühere Niveau hinausging.Wie also sollen wir diese Phase der Abschottung bewerten? Positiv, weil die Märkte relativ stabil waren? Oder negativ weil der Wettbewerb beschränkt war und bestimmte Interessensgruppen profitierten? Ohne eine klare Definition der Ziele von Politik und eine möglichst genaue Überprüfung, ob diese Ziele erreicht wurden, lassen sich diese Fragen nicht beantworten.Deshalb versuchen wir heute, dass abstrakte Ziel mehr Finanzstabilität auf messbare Zwischenziele herunter zu brechen. Zum Beispiel fragen wir, wie stark die Kreditvergabe steigt und wie gut die Banken kapitalisiert sind. Messbare Zwischenziele sind Voraussetzung für eine Politikevaluation. Sie zeigen an, wie gut die Politik ihre Ziele erreicht. Und die Zwischenziele sind eng mit den Instrumenten verbunden, die uns in der Regulierung zur Verfügung stehen.Dieser Dreiklang zwischen Ziel – Zwischenziel – Instrument mag noch wenig konkret klingen. Deswegen möchte ich ihn mit einer Analogie zur Geldpolitik verdeutlichen. Das Mandat der Geldpolitik lautet,  Preisstabilität zu gewährleistet. Wie Finanzstabilität ist aber auch Preisstabilität nicht direkt messbar. Deshalb definiert der EZB-Rat Preisstabilität als eine Wachstumsrate des Harmonisierten Verbraucherpreisindex von unter, aber nahe 2 Prozent. Das stellt ein messbares Zwischenziel dar, das mit Hilfe des geldpolitischen Instrumentariums erreicht werden kann.Was für die Geldpolitik gilt, gilt auch für die makroprudenzielle Regulierung. Um mehr Finanzstabilität zu erreichen ist eine angemessene Ausstattung der Banken mit Eigenkapital ein greifbares Zwischenziel und mögliches Instrument. Mehr Eigenkapital stellt einen Puffer im Finanzsystem dar, der hilft Risiken abzufedern und größere Abschreibungen zu verkraften. Diese höhere Widerstandsfähigkeit senkt die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Gläubiger in unsicheren Zeiten ihre Einlagen abziehen und so Banken zum Notverkauf ihrer Vermögenswerte zwingen. Da das Eigenkapital von Banken eine so bedeutsame Rolle spielt, wurden nach der Krise die Anforderungen an das Eigenkapital von Banken erhöht. Zudem können nunmehr Zuschläge auf das Eigenkapital verlangt werden, wenn ein Institut als systemrelevant eingestuft wird oder wenn die Kreditvergabe in einem Land zu stark steigt. In einem solchen Fall kann ein sogenannter Antizyklischer Kapitalpuffer eingeführt werden.Während Eigenkapitalanforderungen bei der bilanziellen Stärke von Banken ansetzen, können Banken auch resistenter gegenüber Krisen gemacht werden, indem die Konzentration von Risiken begrenzt wird. Ein mögliches Instrument sind Großkreditgrenzen, die die Höhe einer Forderung gegenüber einem einzelnen Kreditnehmer beschränken.In Deutschland sind Großkreditgrenzen fester Bestandteil des regulatorischen Instrumentenkastens. Sie wurden als Reaktion auf eine Krise eingeführt, bei der sich eine Bank durch Anlagen in den USA zuerst hoffnungslos überschuldet hatte. Gemeint ist nicht die Hypo Real Estate, sondern die Herstatt Bank. Diese musste 1974 aufgrund von Dollarspekulationen Insolvenz anmelden.Großkreditbeschränkungen sind sicherlich sinnvoll – das hat der Fall Herstatt gezeigt. Das nun herrschende Regime hat aber auch Schwächen, da Staatsanleihen faktisch von den Großkreditgrenzen ausgenommen sind. Großkreditobergrenzen sollten aber für alle Forderungen der Banken gelten, damit diese keinen Anreiz haben, einen hohen Bestand an Staatsanleihen zu halten.Ein anderes Zwischenziel makroprudenzieller Regulierung kann es sein, übermäßiges Kreditwachstum zu verhindern. Vor der Finanzkrise hatten nicht nur Haushalte in den in USA, sondern auch in vielen europäischen Ländern wie Spanien und Irland hohe Immobilienkredite aufgenommen. Als sich das gesamtwirtschaftliche Umfeld verschlechterte, konnten viele dieser Kredite nicht mehr bedient werden. Wie schon in vielen historischen Finanzkrisen führten Übertreibungen auf den Immobilienmärkten dazu, dass das gesamte Finanzsystem in Schieflage geriet. Heute können wir makroprudenzielle Instrumente einsetzen, mit denen sich die Höhe von Immobiliendarlehen in Abhängigkeit vom verfügbaren Einkommen des Kreditnehmers oder der hinterlegten Sicherheit begrenzen lässt.Auch dieses Instrument findet sich in der Geschichte der Bankenregulierung. So führten die Vereinigten Staaten nach einer Wirtschaftskrise 1864 eine sogenannte Loan-to-Value Obergrenze ein. Sie beschränkte Hypothekenkredite auf 50 Prozent des zugrunde liegenden Immobilienwertes. Außerdem wurde die Immobilienkreditvergabe durch Banken auf 25 Prozent ihres Eigenkapitals beschränkt. Diese Maßnahmen trugen dazu bei, dass die meisten Banken das Platzen der damaligen Immobilienblase überlebten.Entsprechende Beschränkungen von Immobilienkrediten können also durchaus sinnvoll sein, um eine zu hohe Verschuldung zu verhindern. Daher beobachtet die Bundesbank den deutschen Immobilienmarkt derzeit sehr genau. Aktuell können zwar keine unmittelbaren Gefahren für die Finanzstabilität ausgemacht werden. Dennoch setzt sich die Bundesbank vorsorglich mit Handlungsoptionen auseinander, um für den Fall vorbereitet zu sein, dass sich die Einschätzung zu den Finanzstabilitätsrisiken in Zukunft ändert.Regulierungen der Finanzmärkte können aber auch noch weiter gehen.  Als Reaktion auf die schwere Wirtschaftskrise zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts wurden nicht nur Kapitalverkehrskontrollen eingeführt. Es wurden Banken auch zahlreiche weitergehende Beschränkungen auferlegt. Ein Beispiel für einen recht drastischen Eingriff in die Funktionsweise von Märkten sind die vom Wirtschaftsministerium festgelegten direkten Zinskontrollen in den 1960er Jahren in Deutschland.In der deutschen Zinsverordnung wurden Höchstsätze für Habenzinsen vom Bundeswirtschaftsministerium in Absprache mit der Bankenaufsicht im Gesetz festgeschrieben. In der Zinsverordnung von 1965 heißt es, dass die Zinsen für kurzfristige Spareinlagen maximal 3¼ Prozent betragen dürfen. Auf Spareinlagen juristischer Personen, die kirchlichen Zwecken dienen, durfte ein halbes Prozent mehr gezahlt werden. Aus heutiger Sicht mag das viel klingen, aber zu dieser Zeit lag auch die Inflationsrate auf einem ähnlichen Niveau und stieg in den 1970er Jahren noch einmal deutlich an.Verbote bestimmter Aktivitäten oder direkte Beschränkungen der Preissetzung von Banken sind weitreichende Eingriffe in die Märkte. Sie sind nur dann gerechtfertigt, wenn gut begründet werden kann, dass andere Instrumente nicht ausreichen, um die Stabilität der Märkte zu verbessern.Bei vielen Maßnahmen ist nicht von vorneherein klar, welche Effekte sie haben. Führt eine Maßnahme dazu, dass die Finanzmärkte stabiler werden? Welche Ausweichreaktionen gibt es? Wie lässt sich verhindern, dass makroprudenzielle Regulierung als trojanisches Pferd für protektionistische oder rein politisch motivierte Markteingriffe verwendet wird?Beim Wein lässt sich nach einiger Zeit recht verlässlich sagen, welches ein guter und welches ein schlechter Jahrgang ist. Ein einfacher Geschmackstest hilft hier weiter. Bei der Frage, welche Effekte Regulierungen der Märkte haben, brauchen wir mehr als einen Geschmackstest. Wir brauchen klare Verfahren, um einmal ergriffene Maßnahmen zu überprüfen und zu evaluieren. Anders als in der Vergangenheit haben wir dazu heute neue Institutionen und bessere Datengrundlagen.Makroprudenzielle Regulierung ist heute in einen internationalen und europäischen Rahmen eingebettet. Auf internationaler Ebene beschäftigt sich der Financial Stability Board – oder Finanzstabilitätsrat – mit der Frage, wie unsere Datenbasis verbessert werden kann und welche zusätzlichen Regulierungen erforderlich sind. Auf europäischer Ebene beobachtet der Europäischen Ausschuss für Systemrisiken die Stabilität der Finanzmärkte, und er gibt Warnungen und Empfehlungen an die nationalen Regierungen. Denn die Entscheidung über makroprudenzielle Maßnahmen liegt weiterhin auf der nationalen Ebene.In Deutschland wird die makroprudenzielle Regulierung durch den Ausschuss für Finanzstabilität koordiniert. Seine stimmberechtigten Mitglieder sind je drei Vertreter der Bundesbank, der BaFin und des Bundesfinanzministeriums. Die Bundesbank spielt in diesem Gremium eine besondere Rolle, denn sie liefert die Analysen zu und hat ein Vetorecht.Diese neuen Institutionen sind komplex, und die Entscheidungsprozesse müssen sich an vielen Stellen noch einpendeln. Aber wir sind auch mit diesen Gremien einen entscheidenden Schritt weiter gekommen. Denn über diese Gremien findet ein sehr intensiver Informations- und Erfahrungsaustausch zwischen Ländern statt. Es werden Standards gesetzt, an die sich die einzelnen Länder halten müssen. Und die internationalen Gremien spielen eine wichtige Rolle bei der Koordination und Evaluation makroprudenzieller Maßnahmen.Dieser Rahmen aus verschiedenen nationalen und supranationalen Behörden bewirkt einen höheren Rechtfertigungszwang und eine höhere Transparenz, auch hinsichtlich der verfolgten Ziele.Möchte ein Mitgliedsstaat der Europäischen Union beispielsweise die Eigenkapitalanforderungen für seine Banken anheben, dann muss das betreffende Land diese Maßnahme auf europäischer Ebene anzeigen. Diese Anzeige umfasst detaillierte Informationen über die Hintergründe, Ziele und möglichen Nebenwirkungen dieser Maßnahme.Eine hohe Transparenz halte ich für entscheidend. Denn sie ermöglicht, ergriffene Maßnahmen anderer Länder und Behörden von außen zu überprüfen. Der Rechtfertigungszwang ist ein wichtiger Baustein effektiver und effizienter Politik, der sich bereits in anderen Politikbereichen bewährt hat.So gibt es beispielsweise ein Rechtfertigungsprinzip im Freihandelsabkommen der Welthandelsorganisation WTO, um verdeckte Handelsbeschränkungen einzudämmen. Es besagt im Kern, dass ein Land auf Nachfrage erklären muss, warum es von internationalen Produktstandards abweicht. So forderte Europa eine Rechtfertigung für die ungewöhnlich hohen japanischen Sicherheitsanforderungen für AlpinSki. Nachdem Japan nicht überzeugend erklären konnte, warum japanischer Schnee anders als europäischer sei, musste es schließlich den internationalen Standard akzeptieren.Der internationale und europäische Rahmen hat eine weitere Stärke: die gegenseitige Anerkennung und teilweise sogar verpflichtende Übernahme von Maßnahmen, die im Ausland eingeführt worden sind. In der europäischen Union gibt es keine Kapitalverkehrskontrollen mehr. Wenn die Immobilienkredite in einem bestimmten Land begrenzt werden sollen, müssen entsprechende Regelungen auch für Kredite aus dem Ausland gelten. Das wird durch das sogenannte Reziprozitätsprinzip erreicht. Führt ein Land einen Antizyklischen Kapitalpuffer ein, muss dieser durch andere Länder anerkannt werden. Dadurch können nicht nur verzerrende Anreizwirkungen vermieden werden. Auch ein Umgehen der Regulierung wird erschwert.Insgesamt halte ich die neuen Institutionen für eine deutliche Verbesserung gegenüber der Zeit vor der Krise. Aber wir können meines Erachtens noch weiter gehen. Der Europäische Rat für Systemrisiken hat beispielsweise einen wissenschaftlichen Beirat, der viele relevante Diskussionen angestoßen und vorangetrieben hat. Über ähnliche Gremien sollten wir auch auf nationaler Ebene nachdenken. Insgesamt können wir den Dialog zwischen Politik und Wissenschaft weiter verbessern. Das erfordert auf Seiten der Politik eine größere Bereitschaft, unabhängige wissenschaftliche Expertise zu berücksichtigen. Auf Seiten der Wissenschaft erfordert es eine ausgewogene Balance zwischen Grundlagenforschung und Anwendungsorientierung; und es erfordert eine Berücksichtigung der institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen, in denen wir arbeiten.Ich bin sehr zuversichtlich, dass dieser verbesserte Dialog zwischen Forschung und Politik gelingen wird. Denn anders als in früheren Jahrzehnten, aus denen viele meiner Beispiele für regulatorische Maßnahmen stammten, haben wir heute eine deutlich verbesserte Infrastruktur für eine gute Evaluation von Politikmaßnahmen. Um zu überprüfen, ob eine bestimmte (makroprudenzielle) Maßnahme ihr Ziel erfüllt, sind einzelwirtschaftliche Informationen erforderlich. Es müssen geeignete empirische Methoden zur Verfügung stehen, mit Hilfe derer Ursache und Wirkung einer Maßnahme möglichst genau abgeschätzt werden können.In beiden Bereichen haben wir erhebliche Fortschritte gemacht. Die Bundesbank stellt sowohl für eigene Analysen als auch für externe Forscher umfangreiche Datensätze bereit. Sie ist zudem in eine Reihe von europäischen Projekten eingebunden, die Quervergleiche zwischen Ländern ermöglichen. Und auch die empirischen, ökonometrischen Methoden sind heute sehr viel weiter entwickelt. Hier kann die Bundesbank an ihre langjährige Tradition anknüpfen, neue wissenschaftliche Methoden für die Politikanalyse nutzbar zu machen.Wie sich ein bestimmter Wein-Jahrgang entwickelt, entscheidet sich oft erst nach einigen Jahren. Viele Einflüsse von außen spielen eine Rolle. Ganz ähnlich ist es bei der makroprudenziellen Regulierung. Jede Entscheidung über eine bestimmte Maßnahme wird unter einem erheblichen Maß an Unsicherheit getroffen. Ob es Ausweichreaktionen gegeben hat, ob die Ziele einer Maßnahme erreicht werden, werden wir oft erst im Nachhinein wissen. Die Erfahrungen der Vergangenheit zeigen, dass gut gemeinte Maßnahmen auch zweckentfremdet werden können.Gerade in einem so jungen Politikfeld wie der makroprudenziellen Regulierung ist daher eine gute Evidenzbasierung erforderlich. Wir brauchen eine gut empirische Fundierung, um die Wirkungen der Politikmaßnahmen im Nachhinein untersuchen und bewerten können. Nur so können wir die Wirkung makroprudenzieller Maßnahmen über die Zeit beobachten, dokumentieren und analysieren.Gleichzeitig müssen wir einen Dialog mit der Öffentlichkeit darüber führen, welche Maßnahmen wir einsetzen können, um die Finanzmärkte stabiler zu machen – und welche Herausforderungen dabei vor uns liegen.

"2014-10-13 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","zunächst einmal danke ich Ihnen sehr für diese Einladung nach Bielefeld! Und dieser Dank ist mehr als eine freundliche Höflichkeit zu Beginn. Denn auch in diesem Fall merkte ich: Reisen bildet. So weiß ich nun aus erster Hand, Dank meiner Vorbereitung auf diesen Termin, erstens, dass Ostwestfalen eine Region der Hidden Champions ist – manche Champions sind allerdings auch weniger versteckt – , und zweitens, dass Bethel als Heimat der v. Bodelschwinghschen Stiftungen mit seinen vielen Einwohnern kein Ort im Umland, sondern ein richtiger, und dazu noch sehr zentrumsnaher Stadtteil von Bielefeld ist.Doch Sie sind sicher nicht gekommen, um Details meines Lernfortschritts in Sachen Bielefeld zu hören. Deshalb komme ich nun auch ohne Umschweife zu meinem eigentlichen Thema.Mervyn King, der frühere Gouverneur der Bank von England, hat das Anforderungsprofil an einen Notenbanker einmal so beschrieben: am besten langweilig, best is boring. Das war im Jahr 2000. In Zeiten von Finanzkrise, Schuldenkrise, Bankenkrise und Deflationssorgen trifft diese stille Sehnsucht der Notenbanker leider auf eine gar nicht einfache Realität. Im Zuge der Krisenpolitik sind die Notenbanken ins Zentrum der Aufmerksamkeit gerückt. Ihre Arbeit wird zunehmend politisiert und – ja – auch zunehmend personalisiert.Der frühere Chefökonom des Internationalen Währungsfonds, Raghuram Rajan, hat im vergangenen Jahr gesagt: Notenbanker genießen heute die Popularität von Rockstars. Mittlerweile ist Rajan selbst Notenbankgouverneur, nämlich in Indien, und ich weiß nicht, ob er sich selbst jetzt auch als Rockstar fühlt. Immerhin weiß er um die Fallhöhe, die mit den hohen Erwartungen an die Notenbanken verbunden ist. Ergänzend sagt er nämlich – ich zitiere auf Englisch: […] the transformation from hero to zero can be swift.Ich möchte heute über die Zukunft der Europäischen Währungsunion sprechen, aber auch darüber, wie es zu jener schweren Krise im Euro-Raum kommen konnte, was jetzt getan werden muss, um sie dauerhaft zu überwinden – und was man besser nicht tun sollte.In den ersten Jahren nach ihrem Start war die Währungsunion scheinbar ein voller Erfolg. Als der Euro seinen 10. Jahrestag hatte, wurde die Gemeinschaftswährung groß gefeiert. Beispielhaft zitiere ich aus einer Veröffentlichung der Europäischen Kommission vom Mai 2008: Zehn Jahre nach seiner Einführung kann man sagen, dass der Euro ein voller Erfolg ist. Die einheitliche Währung ist zu einem Symbol Europas geworden, das von den Bürgern (…) als eines der positivsten Ergebnisse der europäischen Integration gesehen wird. (…) Die Europäische Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion sichert makroökonomische Stabilität und fördert grenzüberschreitenden Handel, finanzielle Integration und Investitionen. Das wurde wie gesagt im Mai 2008 geschrieben.Sechs Jahre später und nach mehr als vier Jahren Staatsschuldenkrise im Euro-Raum mutet diese außerordentlich positive Bilanz von damals etwas befremdlich an, – wobei man fairerweise hinzufügen muss, dass die Kommission in ihrem Bericht auch auf Probleme und Herausforderungen hingewiesen hat.Zur Erfolgsbilanz des Euro zählt zweifelsohne, dass das Versprechen einer stabilen Währung eingehalten wurde. In den ersten 15 ½ Jahren nach der Euro-Einführung lag die durchschnittliche Inflationsrate bei 2,0 Prozent und damit grosso modo im Einklang mit dem Stabilitätsziel des EZB-Rats. Dieser Erfolg ist nicht zuletzt das Ergebnis einer stabilitätsorientierten Geldpolitik, die von einem unabhängigen System von Zentralbanken verantwortet wird.Die Krise im Euro-Raum hat jedoch eindrücklich vor Augen geführt, dass die Geldpolitik auch von Bedingungen abhängt, die sie selbst nicht beeinflussen kann. Solide Staatsfinanzen sind eine solche Bedingung: Geraten die Staatsfinanzen aus dem Ruder, wird es für die Zentralbank schwer, Preisstabilität zu gewährleisten. Das gilt besonders in einer Währungsunion. Mit der europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion wurde die Geldpolitik vergemeinschaftet. Die Finanzpolitik aber blieb in der Entscheidungshoheit der Mitgliedstaaten. Von dieser Konstruktion geht aber ein gravierender Fehlanreiz aus, nämlich eine verstärkte Verschuldungsneigung bei den Staaten.Auch in Ländern mit eigener Währung besteht ja die Neigung, Lasten auf folgende Generationen zu verschieben, indem die Staaten regelmäßig mehr ausgeben, als sie über Steuern und Abgaben einnehmen. Zuweilen fühlt man sich an ein Motto von Marx erinnert: Warum soll ich mich um die kommenden Generationen bemühen? Die haben doch noch nie etwas für mich getan. Allen Familienunternehmern hier im Raum tun diese Worte des amerikanischen Komikers Groucho Marx vermutlich in den Ohren weh. Ist für sie doch gerade die Weitergabe eines prosperierenden Unternehmens an die nächste Generation der Lackmustest für die eigene Arbeit.In einer Währungsunion ist die Verschuldungsneigung sogar noch größer als bei einzelnen Staaten, da sich die Kosten übermäßiger Verschuldung zumindest teilweise auf andere Länder überwälzen lassen. Hier verhält es sich wie bei dem Überfischen der Meere, unter dem letztlich alle Anrainerländer leiden. Auch von zu hohen Haushaltsdefiziten gehen negative Wirkungen für die anderen Länder in einer Währungsunion aus, denn am Ende steigen die Zinsen in allen Mitgliedsländern.Dieses Problem wurde im Vorfeld der Währungsunion durchaus gesehen. Deshalb wurden entsprechende Vorkehrungen getroffen. Erstens wurde ein gegenseitiger Haftungsausschluss beschlossen: Die Mitgliedstaaten sind nach dieser so genannten No Bailout-Regel nicht für die Schulden der anderen Mitgliedstaaten verantwortlich und dürfen nicht für diese haften. Zweitens wurde den Notenbanken des Eurosystems untersagt, Kredite an die Mitgliedstaaten zu vergeben oder Staatsanleihen von diesen Staaten direkt zu erwerben. Und drittens wurden Verschuldungsregeln formuliert, die durch den Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt konkretisiert wurden. Übermäßige Staatsdefizite sollten durch ein Verfahren, an dessen Ende finanzielle Sanktionen stehen, möglichst vermieden werden.Leider haben die Mitgliedstaaten den Verschuldungsregeln so viel Respekt entgegengebracht wie einige Fahrradfahrer manchen Verkehrsregeln, nämlich wenig. Das Funktionieren der Lichter an den Rädern scheint teilweise zufällig zu sein, was besonders in der aktuellen Jahreszeit fatal sein kann. In der nahen Fahrradstadt Münster achten die Ordnungshüter sehr stark auf die Beleuchtung der Fahrräder – wurde mir berichtet. Wann immer sie einen Radfahrer anhalten, wird auch die Beleuchtung überprüft. So konnte durch regelmäßige Kontrolle die Quote der Radfahrer, die in der Dunkelheit mit Licht Rad fahren, in sieben Jahren von 40 Prozent auf 96 Prozent gesteigert werden. In Berlin, Paris und Rom hat man es  – im übertragenen Sinn  – mit der Beleuchtung nicht so genau genommen, und auch noch dafür gesorgt, dass dieses Fehlverhalten nicht sanktioniert wird. So haben die fiskalischen Regeln zunehmend an Glaubwürdigkeit verloren.Die Konzentration auf die öffentlichen Finanzen erwies sich als weiterer Schwachpunkt des Ordnungsrahmens der Währungsunion. Gefahren für die Gemeinschaftswährung gehen nämlich auch von anderen Fehlentwicklungen aus. In gewisser Weise haben sich die Mitgliedstaaten im Vorfeld der Währungsunion wie ein Bräutigam verhalten, der vor der Eheschließung eine Diät macht, um in den knapp geschneiderten Hochzeitsanzug zu passen, um sich dann nach der Hochzeit wieder gehen zu lassen.Die Einführung des Euro brachte den früheren Hochzinsländern nämlich einen deutlichen Zinsrückgang. Die Länder profitierten von einem Vertrauensvorschuss und es gab kein Wechselkursrisiko mehr. So floss reichlich Kapital unter anderem von den Kernländern des Euro-Raums wie Deutschland und Frankreich in die Peripherie wie Irland, Spanien, Griechenland, aber auch Italien. Leider wurde viel Geld in den privaten Wohnungsbau oder in den Staatskonsum gesteckt, was sich im Nachhinein als wenig produktiv erwies. Die Kapitalzuflüsse ermöglichten auch eine Zeitlang kräftig steigende Löhne. Da aber die produzierten Gütermengen nicht im gleichen Ausmaß zunahmen, stiegen die Lohnstückkosten. Die internationale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Unternehmen sank rapide.Da die Staaten nun anders als vor der Währungsunion nicht mehr mit einer Abwertung ihrer Währung reagieren konnten, so wie sie es in der Vergangenheit häufig getan hatten, entwickelten sich hohe Leistungsbilanzdefizite. Die private und öffentliche Verschuldung stieg teilweise deutlich an. Kurzum, die Länder lebten jahrelang über ihre Verhältnisse.Die Krise im Euro-Raum ist mehr als eine Staatsschuldenkrise. Sie ist auch eine Zahlungsbilanzkrise und eine Bankenkrise. Die Krise hat aber auf jeden Fall deutlich gezeigt, dass von übermäßiger Verschuldung gravierende Risiken ausgehen. Das wusste man übrigens schon im alten Preußen. Als sich Friedrich I. 1701 zum König in Preußen krönen ließ, wurde eine Generalamnestie verkündet. Ausgenommen waren lediglich Gotteslästerer, Mörder, Hochverräter und – Schuldenmacher.Die Krise hat ebenfalls gezeigt, wie schnell ein überschuldetes Bankensystem die Zahlungsfähigkeit ganzer Staaten gefährden kann. So wurden auch Staaten in ihrer Stabilität bedroht, die – wie Irland und Spanien – vor der Krise eine relativ niedrige Staatsverschuldung hatten. Die Kapitalströme in die Peripherieländer versiegten mit der Krise, die Finanzierung der Schulden war damit nicht mehr möglich – oder nur noch zu sehr hohen Kosten.In dieser Krisensituation haben die Rettungsschirme der Euro-Staaten, der Europäischen Union und des Internationalen Währungsfonds sowie die Maßnahmen der Notenbanken eine Zuspitzung der Krise verhindert. Die Rettungsmaßnahmen wirken, wie die derzeitige Diskussion über das schwache Wirtschaftswachstum zeigt, aber wie Schmerzmittel: Sie lindern die Symptome, sie sind eben keine Ursachentherapie. Und sie haben auch Nebenwirkungen.Während die Kontrolle über die Finanzpolitik in nationaler Hand geblieben ist, wurde die Haftung für die Schulden der Krisenstaaten teilweise vergemeinschaftet, – über die europäischen Rettungsschirme und über eine Geldpolitik, die in den Grenzbereich ihres Mandats gebracht wurde – etwa durch die Ankaufsprogramme für Staatspapiere.Haftung und Kontrolle sind also aus der Balance geraten. Die vielen Unternehmer hier im Raum kennen das Haftungsprinzip nur zu gut, nach dem jeder für die Folgen eigener Entscheidungen einstehen muss. Walter Eucken, der Gründer der Freiburger Schule des Ordoliberalismus, brachte dieses Prinzip denkbar einfach auf den Punkt: Wer den Nutzen hat, muss auch den Schaden tragen. Dies muss eine tragende Säule jeder marktwirtschaftlichen Ordnung sein. Ohne sie gerät die Statik auch der Währungsunion in Schieflage.Was muss nun getan werden, um die Krise dauerhaft zu überwinden und was, um die Währungsunion stabil zu machen?Zur nachhaltigen Überwindung der Krise müssen erstens die skizzierten nationalen Fehlentwicklungen behoben werden, zweitens der Ordnungsrahmen der Währungsunion gestärkt und drittens das Finanzsystem stabiler aufgestellt und besser reguliert werden.Entscheidend ist dabei, dass dem Haftungsprinzip wieder mehr Geltung verschafft wird. Außerdem muss die verhängnisvolle Verknüpfung von maroden Bankbilanzen und unsoliden Staatsfinanzen durchbrochen werden.Grundsätzlich sind zwei Wege denkbar, um Haftung und Kontrolle wieder ins Gleichgewicht zu bringen. Der erste Weg ist, eine echte Fiskalunion zu schaffen, womöglich sogar eine politische Union. Hierzu müsste aber nationale Souveränität an die europäische Ebene abgegeben werden.Für den damaligen Bundesbankpräsident Karl Blessing stand schon 1963 fest: Eine gemeinsame Währung und ein föderales Notenbanksystem sind nur denkbar, wenn es außer einer gemeinsamen Handelspolitik auch eine gemeinsame Finanz- und Budgetpolitik, eine gemeinsame Wirtschafts- und Konjunkturpolitik, eine gemeinsame Sozial- und Lohnpolitik, also eine gemeinsame Politik überhaupt gibt. Das setzt aber auch eine gemeinsame, vielleicht sogar einheitliche Sicht auf die Inhalte dieser Politikbereiche voraus. Davon abgesehen habe ich ehrlich gesagt Zweifel, ob der Wille zu solch weitgehenden Integrationsschritten bei Politik und Bevölkerung in Europa derzeit vorhanden ist. Außerdem müssten die europäischen Verträge und auch nationale Verfassungen umfassend geändert werden.Der zweite Weg besteht darin, den bisherigen Rahmen, wie er 1992 in Maastricht vereinbart wurde, zu bekräftigen und seine Schwachstellen zu beseitigen, neudeutsch könnte man von einem Maastricht 2.0 sprechen. Tatsächlich wurden in den letzten Jahren Reformen des institutionellen Rahmens beschlossen, die als Schritte in Richtung eines Maastricht 2.0 verstanden werden können: Die Regierungen haben einen Fiskalpakt vereinbart, den Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt verschärft und ein Verfahren etabliert, mit dem die gesamtwirtschaftlichen Ungleichgewichte erkannt und beseitigt werden können.Allein der feierliche Beschluss solcher Maßnahmen genügt aber natürlich nicht, denn Papier ist geduldig. Es kommt auf die Umsetzung an. Die Regeln sind nur so gut, wie sie am Ende auch gelebt werden. Und da sind gewisse Zweifel angezeigt. Zweifel ob die strengeren fiskalpolitischen Regeln tatsächlich so strikt angewandt werden, wie angekündigt, ob das neue Regelwerk also tatsächlich verinnerlicht ist.Die ersten Erfahrungen sind hier eher geprägt von zahlreichen Verschiebungen der Ziele, viel Ermessensspielraum, sowie einer sehr komplexen Entscheidungsfindung. Unlängst hat der französische Finanzminister angekündigt, dass sein Land die Defizitgrenze von 3 Prozent nicht 2015, sondern erst 2017 einhalten könne. Und das, nachdem Frankreich bereits ein zweijähriger Aufschub bis 2015 gewährt worden war.Wenn nun die Kommission, die für die Einhaltung der Regel zuständig ist, keine Verfahrensverschärfung anstreben sollte, wäre die Glaubwürdigkeit des Regelwerks stark beschädigt. Gerade die kleineren Programmländer, die sich an die Absprachen gehalten haben, fordern zu Recht, gleiche Maßstäbe auch bei den großen Mitgliedsländern anzulegen.Außerdem gibt es Forderungen nach einer möglichst flexiblen Anwendung des reformierten Stabilitätspakts, der als Zwangsjacke empfunden wird. Sie finden breite Zustimmung; dabei wäre eigentlich eine enge und strenge Auslegung erforderlich.Wenn die Regeln nun aber erneut bis aufs Äußerste gedehnt und gestreckt werden, belastet das ihre Glaubwürdigkeit massiv. Wir dürfen schließlich nicht vergessen, dass die Staatsschuldenkrise damit begann, dass die Finanzmärkte einzelnen Euro-Ländern das Vertrauen in die Tragfähigkeit der Staatsschulden entzogen hatten. Dieses Vertrauen gewinnt man meines Erachtens nicht mit einer Abkehr vom Konsolidierungskurs zurück.In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich noch einen ehemaligen Bundesbankpräsidenten zitieren, nämlich Hans Tietmeyer. Auch ihn hatten Sie bereits zu einem Unternehmertag als Redner eingeladen, und zwar im Jahr 1994. Er sagte hier vor genau 20 Jahren: Länder, die gemeinsam eine Währungsunion bilden wollen, müssen sich aber vor allem auch durch einen hohen Grad an Konvergenz ihrer Wirtschaftspolitiken und ihrer Wirtschaftsentwicklung hinsichtlich Geldwertstabilität und gesunder Staatsfinanzen auszeichnen. Nur wenn die Kriterien dafür strikt angewendet werden, kann die Europäische Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion eine Stabilitätsgemeinschaft werden.Die Finanzmärkte haben später der Voraussetzung gesunder Staatsfinanzen offenkundig wenig Bedeutung beigemessen. Oder sie haben an der Nicht-Beistandsklausel gezweifelt, also am gegenseitigen Haftungsausschluss; auch das hat die Schuldenkrise gezeigt. Wenn ich Sie heute fragen würde, ob Sie eine Bundesanleihe mit Rendite von 5,0 Prozent oder eine griechische Staatsanleihe mit einer Verzinsung von 5,1 Prozent bevorzugen, würden Sie wohl ganz sicher nach der deutschen Staatsanleihe greifen. Vor der Krise waren Investoren aber tatsächlich bereit, für einen derart geringen Risikoaufschlag griechische Anleihen zu kaufen. Das hing sicher auch mit einer hohen Risikoneigung und Jagd nach Rendite zusammen, zeugt aber vor allem von Zweifeln, dass es tatsächlich keine gegenseitige Haftung gibt.Um das Haftungsprinzip auch hier effektiv umzusetzen, müssten in letzter Konsequenz Insolvenzen von Staaten möglich sein. Eine staatliche Insolvenzordnung ist daher Bedingung für einen dauerhaft tragfähigen Ordnungsrahmen mit nationaler Fiskalhoheit. Die Fortschritte in dieser Richtung sind bislang aber eher bescheiden.Zu den wichtigsten Gläubigern des Staates zählen die Banken, insbesondere die heimischen. Ein staatlicher Zahlungsausfall stellt für die Banken ein gravierendes Existenzrisiko dar, zumal die Banken Staatsanleihen nicht oder nur mit wenig Eigenkapital unterlegen. Dieses Eigenkapital wäre aber notwendig, um eventuelle Verluste aus den Papieren tragen zu können. Eine funktionierende Währungsunion setzt daher auch ein robustes Bankensystem voraus und ein Finanzsystem, das die Insolvenz und Abwicklung von Banken verkraftet, aber auch mit einem staatlichen Zahlungsausfall umgehen kann.Mit der neuen Europäischen Bankenunion wurde ein einheitlicher Aufsichtsmechanismus geschaffen. Damit übernimmt die EZB in drei Wochen die Verantwortung für die Bankenaufsicht im Euro-Raum. Die 120 bedeutendsten Banken wird sie direkt beaufsichtigen. Die weniger bedeutenden Kreditinstitute werden weiterhin von nationalen Aufsichtsbehörden kontrolliert, jedoch unter der Oberaufsicht der EZB.Um Klarheit über wesentliche Risiken dieser Banken zu haben, aber auch damit keine Gemeinschaftshaftung für Altlasten entsteht, prüft die EZB die Banken seit Monaten auf Herz und Nieren. Die Ergebnisse dieser Prüfung sollen in ca. 14 Tagen veröffentlicht werden; aktuell gilt eine Schweigephase, so dass ich über mögliche Erkenntnisse hier nichts sagen kann. Aber es ist bereits jetzt klar, dass die umfangreiche Bilanzüberprüfung ein Erfolg ist, denn sie hat dazu geführt, dass die Banken ihre Eigenkapitalbasis deutlich gestärkt haben. Ein solide aufgestellter, gut kapitalisierter Bankensektor wiederum ist auch eine wichtige Voraussetzung dafür, dass die Kreditvergabe in Europa wieder anspringt.Das andere zentrale Element ist der gemeinsame Abwicklungsmechanismus. Er soll ermöglichen, dass nicht-überlebensfähige Institute geordnet vom Markt genommen werden können, ohne die Finanzstabilität zu gefährden. Künftig werden dem Haftungsprinzip entsprechend vorrangig die Eigentümer und Gläubiger an den Kosten der Abwicklung beteiligt. Erst danach springt ein europäischer Abwicklungsfonds ein, der sich aus Beiträgen der Banken speist. Der Steuerzahler wird von der ersten in die letzte Verteidigungslinie rücken.Die beiden Elemente der Bankenunion bilden eine sinnvolle Einheit, in der Haftung und Kontrollen ausbalanciert sind: Institute, die auf europäischer Ebene beaufsichtigt werden, sollten auch auf europäischer Ebene abgewickelt werden.Allerdings birgt die Bankenunion das Risiko einer problematischen Haftungsvergemeinschaftung, wenn wichtige Einflussfaktoren auf die Bankbilanzen weiterhin national bestimmt werden. Deshalb ist der vereinbarte graduelle Übergang auf eine gemeinschaftliche Haftung durch den gemeinsamen Abwicklungsfonds angemessen.Bei der Bankenregulierung sind beachtliche Fortschritte erzielt worden. Die verschärften Eigenkapitalregeln nach Basel III zwingen Banken, mehr und hochwertigeres Eigenkapital vorzuhalten, um Verluste besser abfedern zu können. Für den Fall, dass eine Bank trotzdem scheitert, sorgt die europäische Abwicklungsrichtlinie (BRRD) in Zukunft dafür, dass Banken geordnet restrukturiert oder abgewickelt werden können und Investoren dabei in Haftung genommen werden.Manche Krisenmaßnahmen des Eurosystems haben in der Tendenz allerdings dazu geführt, dass sich die Banken noch stärker mit hochverzinslichen Anleihen von Krisenstaaten vollgesogen haben. Das hat ihre Anfälligkeit noch erhöht. Die fatale Verflechtung zwischen Banken und Staaten hat stark krisenverschärfend gewirkt. Strauchelnde Banken und wankende Staaten haben sich gegenseitig nach unten gezogen.Bislang müssen die Banken im Euro-Raum für Ausleihungen an Euro-Länder kein Eigenkapital hinterlegen, da diese als risikolos gelten. Die Staatsschuldenkrise hat aber gezeigt, dass dies keineswegs der Fall ist. Deswegen plädiere ich seit längerem dafür, die regulatorische Bevorzugung von Ausleihungen an den Staat zu beenden. Staatsanleihen sollten künftig risikoadäquat mit Eigenkapital unterlegt werden. Zusätzlich sollten für sie – genau wie für Ausleihungen an Private – Kreditobergrenzen gelten, um Klumpenrisiken zu vermeiden.Die Bundesbank hat außerdem bereits vor mehr als drei Jahren vorgeschlagen, neben einer Aufnahme von Umschuldungsklauseln, den so genannten Collective Action Clauses, die Anleihebedingungen auch dahin gehend zu ergänzen, dass sich die Laufzeit der Staatsanleihen automatisch beispielsweise um drei Jahre verlängert, wenn einem Land ein ESM-Hilfskredit gewährt wird.Bei solchen Neuregelungen sind Übergangsfristen nötig. Aber solche Bedenken sollten die europäischen Politiker nicht davon abhalten, bereits heute das langfristig Richtige zu beschließen. Solange das Bankensystem nicht dafür gerüstet ist, die Insolvenz eines Staates zu verkraften, werden solche Insolvenzen nicht umsetzbar sein und es wird Zweifel an der Glaubwürdigkeit der No-Bailout-Klausel geben.Meine Damen und Herren, es reicht nicht, nur die Banken zu sanieren, auch andere nationale Fehlentwicklungen müssen für eine stabile Währungsunion korrigiert werden.Um die Krise zu überwinden, haben Krisenländer bereits Strukturreformen umgesetzt. Die strukturellen Haushaltsdefizite wurden deutlich reduziert, ebenso die Leistungsbilanzdefizite. Die gesamtwirtschaftlichen Lohnstückkosten sind mit Ausnahme Italiens deutlich gesunken. Dadurch hat sich die preisliche Wettbewerbsfähigkeit in vielen Ländern erheblich verbessert, was sich in höheren Exporten niederschlägt.Die Beispiele Spanien und Irland zeigen, dass sich Strukturreformen auszahlen. Die Regierungen beider Länder konnten kürzlich die Wirtschaftsprognosen nach oben revidieren. Die Reformnachzügler Frankreich und Italien werden dagegen immer mehr zu Sorgenkindern der Währungsunion. Die guten Nachrichten aus den Krisenländern bedeuten aber nicht, dass der Anpassungsprozess dort schon abgeschlossen ist. Er gleicht eben einem Marathonlauf. Da gilt es gerade auf der zweiten Hälfte der Strecke, Durchhaltewillen zu zeigen!Die Märkte für Staatsanleihen legen indessen den Eindruck nahe, die Ziellinie sei bereits überschritten. Die Risikozuschläge der Krisenländeranleihen sind mittlerweile so stark gesunken, dass sich diese Staaten derzeit so günstig verschulden können wie noch nie. Abgesehen davon, dass die Anleihekurse durch die weltweit lockere Geldpolitik gedrückt werden, werden zukünftige Anpassungsfortschritte gewissermaßen eingepreist.Das ist nicht ungefährlich: Zum einen besteht ein gehöriges Rückschlagpotenzial, wenn sich dieser Vertrauensvorschuss als nicht gerechtfertigt erweisen sollte. Und zum anderen dämpft die Entspannung an den Märkten und die expansive Geldpolitik den Reformeifer in den gestressten Ländern. Die IWF-Chefin Christine Lagarde hat es einmal so ausgedrückt: Das größte Risiko ist die Müdigkeit von Regierungen und Bevölkerung, das Gefühl, sie hätten genug getan. Umso wichtiger ist es, dass die Erwartungen erfüllt und weitere Reformen umgesetzt werden. Gerade die großen Länder sollten hier ihrer Vorbildfunktion gerecht werden.So steht auch Deutschland vor großen wirtschaftspolitischen Herausforderungen. Die fortschreitende Globalisierung, energiepolitische Verschiebungen, eine hohe Staatsverschuldung und die Alterung der Gesellschaft werden auch oder sogar gerade Deutschland in den kommenden Jahren stark fordern. Das sind die großen Herausforderungen der nächsten Jahre, denen sich die deutsche Politik stellen muss.Die derzeitige konjunkturelle Abkühlung zeigt, dass auch das deutsche Wachstum nicht immun gegen Störeinflüsse von außen ist. Insofern ist es eine ständige politische Aufgabe, das richtige Umfeld zu schaffen, für unternehmerische Investitionen, Innovationen und damit auch Beschäftigung.Ich habe nicht das Gefühl, dass alle wirtschaftspolitischen Beschlüsse der letzten Zeit dem gerecht werden. Im Wall Street Journal war Anfang dieses Jahres die Überschrift zu lesen: Euro Zone's Next Reform Candidate: Germany. Das mag etwas überspitzt sein, ist aber gar nicht so abwegig. Wir sollten uns jedenfalls nicht in Selbstgefälligkeit sonnen. Der Euro-Raum wird nur dann stark und wirtschaftlich leistungsfähig sein, wenn es auch alle einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten sind.Der Schlüssel zur nachhaltigen Überwindung der Krise im Euro-Raum liegt also bei der Politik und nicht bei den Notenbanken. Geldpolitische Maßnahmen können Strukturreformen und Korrekturen am Ordnungsrahmen nicht ersetzen. Umgekehrt würde ein stabiler Ordnungsrahmen das Eurosystem aber davor schützen, ständig die Krisenfeuerwehr zu sein.  Die Krisenmaßnahmen des Eurosystems haben einer Eskalation der Krise entgegengewirkt. Das Eurosystem ist mit einigen dieser Maßnahmen aber in den Grenzbereich seines Mandats vorgestoßen. Darauf habe ich wiederholt hingewiesen.Wenn eine Notenbank ihr Preisstabilitätsziel auf absehbare Zeit zu verfehlen droht, dann sollte sie nach geeigneten Maßnahmen suchen, um dieser Entwicklung entgegenzusteuern. Nur so kann sie glaubwürdig bleiben. Das gilt nach oben wie nach unten, also sowohl im Falle einer erwarteten zu starken Teuerung als auch im Falle einer sich abzeichnenden dauerhaft zu niedrigen Preissteigerung.Deshalb hat der EZB-Rat die Leitzinsen auch drastisch gesenkt und außerdem im Juni gezielte langfristige Refinanzierungsgeschäfte beschlossen, die dazu beitragen sollen, die Kreditvergabe der Banken an den privaten Sektor anzuregen. Allerdings dürfen wir nicht ausblenden, dass auch noch so günstige Finanzierungsbedingungen kaum in höheren Investitionen oder Ausgaben münden, wenn die ökonomischen Rahmenbedingungen nicht stimmen, zum Beispiel weil die Unsicherheit hoch ist, die wirtschaftlichen Perspektiven düster sind oder die Bilanzbereinigung bei Banken und Unternehmen belastend wirken.Sicher wissen Sie, dass der EZB-Rat zuletzt auch Ankaufprogramme von Pfandbriefen und strukturierten Wertpapieren, so genannte Kreditverbriefungen oder ABS, beschlossen hat. Und sicher wissen Sie auch, dass wir diesen Beschluss kontrovers diskutiert haben. Was mir in diesem Zusammenhang Sorgen bereitet, ist die Gefahr, dass auch Kreditverbriefungen schwächerer Qualität zum Kauf anstehen. Zudem kann es dazu kommen, dass überhöhte Preise bezahlt werden. Dann würden aber Kreditrisiken, die von privaten Banken eingegangen wurden, ohne angemessenen finanziellen Ausgleich auf die Notenbank und damit letztlich auf den Steuerzahler verlagert. Ein solcher Risikotransfer untergräbt aber die von mir bereits dargestellten Bemühungen, dem Haftungsprinzip wieder mehr Geltung zu verschaffen.Was Sie als Bürger natürlich ganz unmittelbar erleben, sind die derzeitigen Minizinsen. Und ich bin mir im Klaren darüber, dass sich Ihre Begeisterung darüber in Grenzen hält. Im Gegenteil: Auch in diesem Raum werden sich viele darüber ärgern, dass die Zinsen so niedrig sind, dass sie gerade bei kurzfristigen Geldanlagen häufig von der Teuerung mehr als aufgefressen werden.Sparzinsen, die geringer sind als die Inflationsrate, sind allerdings gar nicht so ungewöhnlich, wie man vielleicht denkt. Es hat sie schon häufiger gegeben, auch zu D-Mark-Zeiten, typischerweise als Reaktion auf tiefe wirtschaftliche Einbrüche, wie zum Beispiel in den 70er Jahren - Stichwort Ölkrise.Niedrige Zinsen ermöglichen gleichzeitig günstige Investitionen, die das Wirtschaftswachstum ankurbeln. Bleiben sie jedoch über einen längeren Zeitraum sehr niedrig, kann die Jagd nach Rendite die Finanzakteure zu riskanten Geschäften verleiten, die Übertreibungen an den Aktien- und Immobilienmärkten bewirken und letztlich die Finanzstabilität beeinträchtigen können. Diese Finanzstabilität sollte die Geldpolitik auch im Auge behalten.Finanzstabilität ist aber etwas anderes als Preisstabilität. Deswegen benötigt Finanzstabilitätspolitik auch ein eigenes Instrumentarium, denn genauso wenig, wie man normalerweise zwei Fliegen mit einer Klappe schlagen kann, kann man unterschiedliche wirtschaftspolitische Ziele mit einem Instrument erreichen.Zum Instrumentenkasten der Finanzstabilitätspolitik gehören zum Beispiel antizyklische Eigenkapitalpuffer für Banken oder Begrenzungen des Beleihungsauslaufs von Immobilienkrediten. Verglichen damit ist der geldpolitische Leitzins ein recht grobes Werkzeug. Wenn aber das Skalpell benötigt wird, sollte man nicht den Vorschlaghammer auspacken. Allerdings muss ehrlicherweise auch erwähnt werden, dass die Wirksamkeit dieses Instrumentenkastens noch nicht abschließend erprobt ist.Im Hinblick auf die Geldpolitik muss aber klar sein, dass sich das Eurosystem stets am Primärziel der Preisstabilität ausrichtet. Dieses Ziel darf nicht relativiert werden. Andernfalls könnte die Glaubwürdigkeit der Geldpolitik gefährdet werden. Darin ist sich der EZB-Rat einig.Wir dürfen als Geldpolitik aber auch nicht an der Seitenlinie stehen und zusehen, wie sich die nächste Krise zusammenbraut. Mit geldpolitischen Instrumenten sollten wir sich aufbauenden finanziellen Ungleichgewichten dann entgegentreten, wenn sich daraus Risiken für die Geldwertstabilität abzeichnen. Um es mit den Worten von Mark Carney, dem Gouverneur der Bank von England, zu sagen: Geldpolitik ist die letzte Verteidigungslinie im Kampf gegen Instabilität im Finanzsystem.Meine Damen und Herren, die Geldpolitik darf sich nicht von ihrem klaren Kurs in Sachen Preisstabilität abbringen lassen: weder aus Gründen der Finanzstabilität, noch wegen der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit oder der Solvenz der Mitgliedstaaten. Die Geldpolitik darf nicht den Einflüsterungen mancher Politiker erliegen und an der Niedrigzinspolitik für einen längeren Zeitraum festhalten, als es für die Sicherung der Preisstabilität notwendig wäre. Selbst wenn die Staatsschulden im Euro-Raum leichter zu tragen wären. Auch mit einer solchen Politik würden wir das Vertrauen der Bürger in unsere Stabilitätsorientierung aufs Spiel setzen. Letztlich würden wir unser wichtigstes Kapital verspielen, denn Geld ist nun mal nichts anderes als verfestigtes Vertrauen. Der beste Beitrag der Notenbanken zur Überwindung der Krise ist und bleibt die Gewährleistung der Preisstabilität; dieses Ziel sollte stets Vorrang haben.Die in den Europäischen Verträgen festgeschriebene Unabhängigkeit der Notenbanken sollte helfen, eine stabilitätsorientierte Politik durchzusetzen. Die Unabhängigkeit ist also kein Selbstzweck, sondern Mittel zum Zweck. Und es lässt sich empirisch zeigen, dass unabhängige Notenbanken erfolgreicher das Preisniveau stabil halten können als abhängige Notenbanken; das hat sich gerade in den hochinflationären Zeiten der 70er Jahre gezeigt. Im Gegenzug sollte das Eurosystem die engen Grenzen respektieren, die die Europäischen Verträge der Geldpolitik setzen. Andernfalls riskiert es, dass seine Unabhängigkeit zu Recht in Frage gestellt wird.Meine Damen und Herren, lassen Sie mich zum Schluss kommen. Albert Einstein hat einmal gesagt: Mehr als die Vergangenheit interessiert mich die Zukunft, denn in ihr gedenke ich zu leben.Mit den vergangenen Krisenjahren habe ich mich deshalb beschäftigt, um zu erklären, welches meines Erachtens die richtigen Schritte in eine stabile Zukunft sind.Wie steht es nun um die Zukunft der Währungsunion? Falsch wäre es, zu glauben, die Krise sei weitgehend überwunden, nur weil die besonders auffälligen Krisensymptome nachgelassen haben. Es sind zweifellos wichtige Anpassungsfortschritte erzielt und Reformschritte eingeleitet worden, aber es sind weitere Anstrengungen vonnöten, sowohl bei Strukturreformen in den Mitgliedstaaten als auch bei der Stärkung des Ordnungsrahmens. Die Bankenunion ist hier ein wichtiger Schritt hin zu einer dauerhaft stabilen Währungsunion.Ich habe zu Beginn meines Vortrags aus dem Bericht zu zehn Jahren Währungsunion zitiert. Wie wird man den Euro bei seinem 20. Jubiläum beurteilen? Die Währungsunion hatte gewissermaßen eine glückliche Kindheit, eine etwas konsequentere Erziehung hätte ihr aber manchmal gut getan. Nun ist sie mitten in den Teenager-Jahren, die häufig schwierigere Jahre sind, in denen aber wichtige Weichenstellungen fürs Erwachsenenleben getroffen werden. Es kommt nun darauf an, für die Währungsunion die Weichen richtig zu stellen.",2014-10-13,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-10-13,"Bielefeld","Germany","Unternehmertag Ostwestfalen-Lippe 2014","Voraussetzungen für eine stabile Währungsunion",4368,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DE"
"2014-10-14 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","There are surely few places more aptly suited for a meeting of the American Council on Germany than Chicago. In the aftermath of the failed German Revolution of 1848, Chicago welcomed Germans seeking political or economic refuge. The German population in Chicago rose fivefold in five years, amounting to one-sixth of the total population of Chicago in 1850. And the Forty-Eighters, as they soon became known, turned out to be only the vanguard of a sustained wave of German immigration into the US, and into the Midwest in particular.In a sense, the person standing in front of you today is also part of this wave, since I originally hail from Des Moines. But I admit that this ripple is a rather belated one.Charles de Gaulle once said: There are no friendships between states, only alliances. My personal experience is a different one. I believe that in the case of the US and Germany, our myriad personal and historical ties do translate into a friendship even in the public domain. But de Gaulle is of course right in that relationships between states are defined by interests as much as by anything else.Here, too, our countries are bound together tightly. Being a central banker, I will confine myself to our shared interests in the economic and financial sphere. And being part of the Eurosystem, I will concentrate on what is in the mutual interest of both Germany and the US: the conditions for a sustained and stable recovery in the euro area.The already modest economic recovery in the euro area faltered in the second quarter. Seasonally adjusted GDP remained unchanged in spring. The biggest three economies - Germany, France and Italy - did not provide any growth impetus, with Germany and Italy contracting by 0.2 percent and France's economy stagnating. Euro-area GDP is still 2.4 percent below its pre-crisis level, and indicators suggest only a moderate upward movement in the coming quarters.Looking at the recovery so far, one could be reminded of a starting aeroplane. It has entered the runway and begun to roll, but it not yet clear whether the euro-area jet will reach the necessary take-off speed. The obvious question, then, is: what can we do to remove ballast, and push the plane into full throttle? Let me start by taking a look at what ballast is still weighing on the euro area.For many euro-area member states, the introduction of the euro ushered in a new era of abundant capital, due to the elimination of exchange rate risks. And standard economic reasoning does suggest that capital should flow from capital-rich to capital-poor economies, where returns should be higher.However, the favourable financing conditions in the euro-area countries with previously higher interest rates stimulated their domestic demand. A procyclical real interest rate effect then ensued. Higher domestic demand led to above-average inflation rates in the respective countries. While nominal interest rates hardly differed across the euro area, real interest rates were below-average in the countries concerned.At the same time, higher demand caused wages to rise as well, which pushed the real exchange rate up and reduced price competitiveness. This in turn dampened exports. But the dampening effect on the tradable sector was not sufficient to moderate overall wages. In other words, the interest rate effect dominated the exchange rate effect. Consequently, worsening exports did not trigger the necessary adjustment, and current account deficits continued. As a result, the deficit countries built up ever-larger external imbalances.Structural rigidities amplified this process. Labour market barriers that protected insiders and shut out outsiders impeded wage adjustments. In so doing, they worsened the shift from the tradable to the non-tradable sector. And product market regulations hampered competition, innovation and, ultimately, productivity.When the financial crisis erupted and investors' risk perception shifted, the financing of the external deficits came to a screeching halt, triggering a crisis whose repercussions are still felt to this day.In order for the euro-area recovery to get off the ground, we must rid ourselves first of the ballast of imbalances. And this is exactly what is happening now. Unit labour costs and current accounts of deficit countries have already improved substantially - not only because of shrinking imports, but also because of expanding exports.There are clear signs for sectoral change. The construction sector in Ireland, for instance, has accounted for over half the decrease in aggregate employment. In Spain, Italy and Portugal it has accounted for around two-fifths. In industry, by contrast, either far fewer jobs have been cut or - as in Ireland - new jobs have recently been created. Thus, factors of production are being reallocated to sectors with a strong focus on exports.Already in 2012, real value added in particular far exceeded its pre-crisis level in the export-intensive information and communication sector in Spain and Ireland. In Ireland, other business-related services also showed substantial growth. Compared to its pre-crisis level, real value added in trade and tourism increased in Portugal and remained virtually unchanged in Spain.These sectoral differences are also reflected in credit reallocation in Spain, for example. While loans to the Spanish construction sector have fallen, the more productive export-oriented industrial sector is able to receive loans. This aspect is often forgotten when discussing credit growth in peripheral countries.This shift from the non-tradable to the tradable sector, however, can exert a temporary drag on the recovery. This is because internal demand is reduced faster than the tradable sector expands. In other words, the plane has to slow down a bit to open the hatch and unload the ballast. But after completing the manoeuvre, it will be in a much better position to accelerate to take-off speed.Progress has also been made by overcoming labour market rigidities. A number of labour market reforms have been introduced to foster employment and reduce adjustment costs during economic downswings. As an additional measure, the retirement age has been raised as well.Product market rigidities that weaken competition, produce regulatory red tape and inhibit growth are also being addressed. And according to the World Bank's Doing Business Report, the efforts should be starting to pay off: Portugal, Italy and Spain have climbed up the ranking ladder by 17, 13 and 10 positions respectively over the last four years. Greece has moved up by 37 positions.But it is obvious that there remains ample room for further improvements. While Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece have climbed up the ladder in the Doing Business Report, they are still a considerable distance from the top, with Portugal ranking 31st, Spain 52nd, Italy 65th and Greece 72nd.Accordingly, recent estimates by the European Commission suggest a medium-term growth potential (2014-23) for the euro area of only 1 percent.The potential gains from structural reforms therefore remain especially large. A study by economists from the OECDsuggests that a comprehensive package of labour, product, tax and pension reforms could raise GDP per capita in the EU by about 11 percent after ten years. For the US, the growth potential of structural reforms is 5 percent, less than half compared to the EU.And gains in Europe are by no means restricted to the peripheral countries. Ranked 111th in the World Bank Doing Business category ease of starting a business, for instance, Germany has ample room for improvement as well.To me, there can be no doubt. For the euro area to take off, we need to follow through on structural reforms.Ladies and gentlemen, reforms are needed to remove barriers for investment and growth. But once take-off speed has been reached, it is equally important to ensure that the euro area is resilient enough to withstand turbulences. In this regard, a sound financial system is crucial. What is the yardstick of success with regard to this? To me, it is simple enough: the financial markets have - at least in principle - to work like any other market, and this pertains particularly to market entry, market exit and market power.The problem of too big to fail is one of market exit and market power. If the exit of a single financial institution can jeopardise the whole system, the stability of this system obviously leaves much to be desired. But the market power of the institution in question derived from this phenomenon gives rise to even further risks. If a bank knows it will be bailed out no matter what happens, it will be less diligent when deciding on and monitoring loans. And as we have learned the hard way in the euro area, careless lending can and will eventually come back to haunt you.With regard to the problem of market exit, much has already been achieved in the euro area in the context of the banking union. The single supervisory mechanism ensures supervision at arm's length, guided by the same, strict standards. Excessive bank risks should hence be detected earlier. And if push comes to shove and a bank is no longer viable, the Single Resolution Mechanism stipulates that shareholders and creditors are first in line to bear banks' losses - and not the taxpayer.  However, history has shown that fear of contagion effects is a strong deterrent when it comes to actually resolving an important bank. And whether bailing in creditors would lead to contagion naturally depends on who these creditors are - if they are other financial institutions, the chances are high that regulators will shy away from resolution.Within the framework of the Financial Stability Board, work is ongoing at the global level to define a minimum standard on liabilities in terms of both quality and quantity that are eligible for bail-in. In order to tackle the issue of contagion, this standard should discourage other financial institutions from holding these liabilities.The euro area already has a minimum requirement for such eligible liabilities. But so far, these liabilities can be held by other institutions without restriction. In the interest of financial stability, Europe should lead the way and change this.Resolution is obviously only the last line of defence against a bank failure. Higher bank equity is the first. Basel III with its more stringent requirements reduces the likelihood that losses will run a bank into trouble. And as the banks' shareholders have more skin in the game, their risk appetite should moderate, which reduces the likelihood of losses in the first place.The new capital requirements are not exactly loved by bankers. Their argument is straightforward: equity is expensive. This is undoubtedly true. But as Franco Modigliani and the University of Chicago's Merton Miller already pointed out in the late 1950s, in theory, the total cost of a bank's capital stems from the riskiness of its assets, not from the composition of its liabilities.This theorem, however, obviously does not hold today, and mainly for one simple reason. Interest on debt is tax-deductible; pay-outs on equity are not.How sensitive are banks to this difference in tax treatment? A study by IMF economists suggests that they are as sensitive as any other firm. What does this imply for the leverage of banks? IMF economists estimate that abolishing the preferential tax treatment of debt would raise average unweighted bank equity by 2.2 to 4.2 percentage points. Even though the authors caution that the effect is likely to be lower for the biggest banks, these numbers are sizable by any measure, especially considering that the proposed Basel III leverage ratio is 3 percent.Doing away with the preferential tax treatment of debt could therefore provide a major boon for financial stability. Of course, equity still carries a risk premium, since it comes first with regard to absorbing gains as well as losses. But if equity ratios are low, debt must bear a bigger part of total risks, which makes it more expensive - at least when banks are allowed to fail. Correspondingly, higher equity ratios will lower the cost of a given unit of equity, since risks will be more widely shared, and the cost of debt will also go down. The total cost of capital will therefore be unchanged, regardless of the equity ratio.Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.With regard to macroeconomic imbalances, much has already been achieved in the euro area. But for the recovery to reach take-off speed, more is required in terms of structural reforms.To make sure financial turbulences do not knock the monetary union off course, resolution regimes should be strengthened so that banks do not hold each other's loss-absorbing liabilities. And to further strengthen banks' equity buffers, the preferential tax treatment of liabilities should be abolished.",2014-10-14,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-10-14,"Chicago","USA","American Council on Germany","The euro - Taking off or staying grounded?",2106,17.6,5,44.3,11.4,"EN"
"2014-10-16 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak at the Bundesbank-BCBS joint workshop. It is a pleasure to be here.When I consider the workshop's topic, accounting and financial regulation, two aspects immediately spring to mind: first, the need for harmonisation and second, the need for transparency. I will elaborate on these thoughts in the course of my speech.In the years prior to the financial crisis, banks became increasingly active in the international arena. They expanded their foreign credit business and broadened their networks of subsidiaries and branches abroad. But banking supervision failed to keep pace with these developments and remained confined within national bounds. It was the financial crisis that finally underscored the need for harmonisation in banking supervision and for greater consistency in the regulatory requirements.We have done a lot of work in Europe to meet these requirements - first and foremost by introducing the Single Rulebook. This package, which amongst others implements the Basel III framework, assures the harmonised implementation of the rules throughout all member states.But when I speak of harmonised regulation, I also think of the foundations upon which banking regulation is built - and that brings us to the topic of our joint workshop. Supervisors need coherent information if they are to supervise banks in an adequate fashion. This is where transparency comes into play, a goal to which accounting and disclosure contribute.In an international context, accounting standards still vary considerably. A very prominent case in point is the different treatment of derivatives under US GAAP and IFRS, and their impact on balance sheets. Different netting rules tend to suggest that European banks' derivatives holdings are much larger than those of their US counterparts. Another example is the leverage ratio: different accounting standards make it difficult to compare leverage ratios across jurisdictions. Hence the need for complex “number crunching” to make leverage ratios internationally comparable. This is hard going for supervisors and the markets alike and inhibits a regulatory level playing field.The different accounting regimes used in the individual countries matter for at least two reasons. First, they directly affect the transparency and comparability of bank balance sheets across national borders, and second, they can potentially also influence bank business strategies in much the same way as regulatory requirements.One of the more widely debated consequences of accounting rules is their potentially procyclical effect on banking business, a topic which was addressed at this workshop. Depending on the accounting requirements for setting aside loan loss provisions, banks may either act with foresight when they anticipate loan losses, or they may be required to wait for evidence to materialise. As a June 2014 study by Berenberg Bank concluded: “With forbearance [on troubled loans] remaining elevated and hidden loan losses a known unknown, we have little faith in the credibility of banks' stated book values.”Another topic addressed today likewise hinges on the accounting framework: the ability to forecast credit losses or rating changes based on the information reported by firms. These examples illustrate how accounting rules can simultaneously impact on a number of distinct areas: financial institutions' corporate policy, the effect and design of banking regulation, the availability of credit to the real economy and, last but not least, the monetary transmission mechanism.As I have shown, harmonised and transparent prudential legislation, underpinned by consistent accounting rules, is crucial for the effective supervision of credit institutions. It is here that Europe is about to usher in a new era. In about two weeks, on 4 November, the European Central Bank will assume responsibility for directly supervising the largest 120 banks in the euro area. These banks account for about 85 percent of banking assets throughout the euro area.In the run-up to assuming supervisory responsibility, the ECBperformed a comprehensive assessment - an asset quality review and a stress test - in collaboration with the national competent authorities. The aim of this exercise is to shed greater light on banks' balance sheets and on the consistency of supervisory practices across Europe so as to ensure that the Single Supervisory Mechanism gets off to a credible start on 4 November. The asset quality review saw banks' balance sheets being analysed for the first time according to a harmonised set of pan-European standards. This ensured a level playing field across national jurisdictions.I am certainly not overstating the case when I describe Europe-level supervision as the most important initiative aimed at financial market integration in Europe since the launch of monetary union. To put it in the words of the IMF, the European banking union is the “logical conclusion of the idea that integrated banking systems require integrated prudential oversight”.In my introductory remarks, I mentioned two watchwords for banking regulation and supervision: harmonisation and transparency. On the topic of harmonisation, the Single Supervisory Mechanism will ensure that banks throughout the euro area are supervised according to a consistent set of standards. This will also enhance the effectiveness of banking supervision, because a joint supervisory approach can tackle cross-border effects more effectively than national supervisors.As for transparency, the SSM will operate on the basis of more comprehensive information and benefit from cross-border comparisons and Europe-wide expertise. Pooling insights into different national and regional economic conditions, legal structures, and especially different banks' business and risk profiles, will facilitate a deeper understanding of the European banking sector. Furthermore, banking oversight at the European level will reduce the probability of national supervisors affording preferential treatment to “their” banks, thus contributing to prudential transparency.So far, I have confined my remarks to the forthcoming European supervisory regime. But the Single Supervisory Mechanism is only the first pillar of the European banking union. In 2016, it will be augmented by the Single Resolution Mechanism. In my view, this mechanism is a vital step towards resolving the “too big to fail” problem. It will allow for an orderly resolution of distressed credit institutions without causing market turmoil. The SRM has the potential to curb supervisory forbearance, foster financial stability and, last but not least, reduce the likelihood of a government bail-out. This is crucially important for severing the nexus between banks' balance sheets and public finances.Ladies and gentlemen, the German Minister of Finance, Wolfgang Schäuble, wrote in the Financial Times this summer that, in an ideal world, Europe would be a political union. If that were so, he wrote, Europe would be best placed to meet the challenges it faced in the 21st century in a way that served its own interests.This is especially true when we look at Europe as banking supervisors. As we have seen, European banks are highly interconnected, and national banking crises tend to spill over national borders. Only with common European mechanisms and institutions can we effectively tackle these developments.But is harmonisation an end in itself? Most certainly not. Harmonisation will always be constrained by the political and legal backdrop in the relevant jurisdiction. And in Europe, we must concede that the ideal world of a political union is still some way off, which means that complete harmonisation remains out of reach. Ever since the EU came into being, European integration has proceeded step by step, with the next step forward always being dictated by what was feasible at the given time. These are the circumstances which all harmonisation projects in Europe need to come to terms with.In the banking supervision sphere we have only an incomplete and imperfect set of instruments and institutions at our disposal. One prominent imperfection I can think of is the lack of control and intervention rights at the European level, which is hindering further integration and harmonisation. As a case in point, the European deposit guarantee scheme cannot be established upon the existing legal basis. It would require common accountability and European control rights - things which are not permitted under European law as it stands. This is why we have shelved the common deposit guarantee scheme for now and are instead concentrating on harmonising national funds. I think it is wise for us to take our time here.Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to close my speech this evening with the words “United in diversity” which, since 2000, have been the European Union's official motto. We have to work together to bring about greater harmonisation in different spheres while at the same time leaving scope for national differences.And I think this applies in equal measure to harmonisation efforts in the field of banking regulation and supervision. We need harmonised rules to facilitate effective and comparable supervision. But at the same time, we need to know the framework conditions we need to navigate: be they the political and legal factors which constrain harmonisation, or be they the upside potential offered by diversity across national banking systems which can foster innovation and provide fresh perspectives.",2014-10-16,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-10-16,"Eltville","Germany","Joint Workshop of the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Research Task Force of the BCBS","The more the merrier?

"2014-10-17 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","I thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity to speak here today. Latvia is the latest member of our Economic and Monetary Union. But in a sense, Latvia's capital could also be considered part of the vanguard.The history of European integration has been a process of back-and-forth, marked by spectacular advances and equally huge setbacks. However, when we did witness progress on the road to integration, more often than not it was driven by one single factor: trade. And when it comes to trade driving integration in Europe, one early example immediately springs to mind: the Hanseatic League.Prior to the foundation of the league, trade in the Baltic Sea was for the adventurous only. Raids and piracy made it a risky endeavour. The scale of international trade in the Baltic area remained insignificant.The growth of the Hanseatic League changed that. From the 13th to the 17th century, stretching from the Baltic to the North Sea, the league protected trade routes and sheltered its members from tariffs and customs restrictions. As a result, trade soared, and with it the wealth of the members of the league.The Hanseatic cities had their own legal system, and they maintained their own armies for mutual protection and aid. But the league did not constitute a federation - similar to the euro area today.Riga's membership in the league dates back to 1282. So when it comes to taking an active role in European integration, Latvia is clearly a leader, not a laggard.Unfortunately, the economic association of which Latvia is now a member does not seem to be leading in terms of economic growth.What will it take to change that? What reforms are needed to spur sustainable growth and enhance stability? What are the respective roles of monetary, fiscal and structural policy in this context? In the next 20 minutes, I wish to lay out my perspective on these questions.But first, let us have a look at where the euro area stands at the moment.Euro-area GDP is still 2.4 percent below its pre-crisis level, and growth stalled in the second quarter of this year. The biggest three economies - Germany, France and Italy - did not provide any growth impetus, with Germany and Italy contracting by 0.2 percent and France's economy stagnating.Although the decline of German GDP in the second quarter must be seen in the context of the strong increase in the first quarter due to the mild winter weather, indicators for the euro area suggest that growth will pick up only at a moderate pace. This is confirmed by the latest data, notably in Germany, which have been rather disappointing.In sync with the subdued pace of the recovery, inflation in the euro area has been low as well. Still, the risk of becoming enmeshed in a deflationary scenario is considered to be low - I think in this respect we share a common view in the Governing Council. Rather than fearing broad-based deflation, the Governing Council is more concerned about a too prolonged period of low inflation.But so far, the low inflationary pressure is for a large part due to the decline in energy prices and the adjustment processes in some euro-area countries - factors beyond the direct influence of the Eurosystem's monetary policy and to which the monetary policy should react - simply speaking - only in the case of second-round effects.Monetary policy in the euro area, then, is facing difficult times - especially as it has reached the lower bound on interest rates. Further accommodation can therefore happen only through unconventional measures.And unconventional measures are what the Governing Council decided on in its June and September meetings with the launch of targeted long-term refinancing operations and two asset purchase programmes, the details of which were presented two weeks ago.The asset purchase programmes have triggered a debate, as their justification insinuates a shift from programmes specifically aimed at credit easing towards a quantitative easing philosophy.One should bear in mind that even before these decisions were made, the monetary policy stance was already very accommodative. The Governing Council therefore has to judge whether additional stimulus is needed or would be effective, and what unintended side-effects would come with the measures.The declared goal of expanding the balance sheet of the Eurosystem poses challenges for another reason, too. Purchases of Asset Backed Securities (ABS) are problematic when they imply a transfer of risks from banks to the balance sheet of the central bank.In the end, this could amount to a transfer of risks from banks to the taxpayer. And this would run counter to everything we have strived to achieve in banking regulation over the last years.The higher the target for the expansion of the Eurosystem's balance sheet, the higher the risks of overpaying for the assets. The pricing mechanism that is currently being determined needs to pay special attention to these risks. In any case, monetary policy accommodation can only do so much, and the longer it stays ultra-expansive, the higher could be the corresponding risks to financial stability.What monetary accommodation definitely cannot do is tackle the root causes of low growth potential in the euro area - the structural barriers that hamper competition, innovation, and hence productivity. Addressing these structural deficiencies would also go a long way towards improving the transmission of monetary policy impulses.In many member states, particularly in those worst hit by the crisis, substantial efforts have already been made towards that end. In order to unleash productivity, labour markets have become more flexible, and competition in goods and services has become more intense.And according to the World Bank's Doing Business Report, the efforts are starting to pay off: Portugal, Italy and Spain have climbed up the ranking ladder by 17, 13 and 10 positions respectively over the last four years. Greece has moved up by 37 positions.But it is obvious that ample room remains for further improvements. While Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece have moved up the ladder in the Doing Business Report, they are still a considerable distance from the top, with Portugal ranking 31st, Spain 52nd, Italy 65th and Greece 72nd.Accordingly, recent estimates by the European Commission suggest a medium-term growth potential (2014-23) for the euro area of only 1 percent.The potential gains from structural reforms therefore remain especially large. A study by economists from the OECDsuggests that a comprehensive package of labour, product, tax and pension reforms could raise GDP per capita in the EU by about 11 percent after ten years. For the US, the potential GDP increase of structural reforms is 5 percent, less than half that of the EU.And by no means are gains to be reaped in the peripheral countries only. Ranked 111th in the World Bank Doing Business category “ease of starting a business”, for instance, Germany has ample room for improvement here as well. And this also goes for other economic policy areas where some reforms have even been rolled back recently.By the same token, growth-enhancing reforms are not confined to the national level. A lot of the potential inherent in our most important European catalyst for growth, the single market, is still untapped.The single market has been very successful in facilitating trade in goods. Hence, competition in this area is intense. The mark-ups that firms are able to charge in addition to their costs due to market power are low and are comparable to those in the US, for example.When it comes to services, however, the picture looks different. Mark-ups are higher, on average, than in the US. It is probably safe to say that the Services Directive has fallen short of expectations. Completing the single market for services therefore holds the promise of substantial economic gains.This could be achieved by finally establishing the “country of origin”, as is already the case in the common market for goods. This principle states that a firm should no longer be hampered by regulation in the importing country if it has already complied with the national regulations in its home country.The same goes for bringing the single market into the digital age. When it comes to the digital economy, fragmentations still abound, in particular with regard to legal issues such as privacy and data protection, content and copyright, liability of online intermediaries, e-payments and electronic contracts. The EU is still comprised of 28 individual digital markets rather than one single digital market.This is holding back innovation, growth and, ultimately, jobs. Studies suggest that establishing a harmonised and well-regulated digital single market holds the same potential as the introduction of the original one, raising GDP by as much as 4 percent. In Germany, for example, this could imply an additional 427,000 jobs over the period 2015 to 2020.Some steps have already been taken towards a true single market for the digital economy, but we are not there yet. Continuing along this path to the end would provide a major boost to European competitiveness. It is therefore more than worth the effort.Another push to EU GDP could potentially stem from an EU-UStrade agreement. The US is the EU's biggest export market and its third most important import partner for trade in goods. The ties between the two regions are even closer in terms of service trade.Given the already low average tariff rates, non-tariff barriers are probably the greatest still-existing impediment to bilateral trade. In the first round, the effects on trade and GDP, however, are level effects, and it is only through increased competition that growth could follow. Furthermore, many aspects of the deal are still highly controversial. The European Commission now hopes to reach an agreement within “a couple of years”.Ladies and gentlemenAn increase in investment is a precondition for higher growth rates. Durable growth requires reforms that cut red tape, spur innovation, and make labour costs more calculable.This is not only conducive to higher growth potential in the future: it acts as a nearer-term stimulus in its own right. Investment is not only tomorrow's supply: it is also today's demand.How does public investment come into this equation?Various commentators have called on euro-area countries with perceived fiscal space, notably Germany, to seize the opportunity presented by low interest rates and increase investment. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's Chief Economist, has argued that this would also help the euro-area periphery. He argues that in the current situation, spillover effects could be particularly high due to monetary policy being constrained by the lower bound on interest rates and the prevalence of liquidity-constrained households.But even if this were the case, the periphery's share of German imports is very low, which suggests that spillovers would remain very modest - all the more as the import content of public investment is especially small. The boost to the peripheral countries from an increase in German public investment is therefore likely to be negligible.What is more, the argument that Germany should seize the opportunity of low interest rates does not hold up to closer scrutiny, either. Debt totalling more than €2 trillion and the huge demographic burden Germany faces in the coming years will weigh on its growth and public finances. In that light, pursuing a balanced budget makes perfect sense for the country.And with the economy operating at normal capacity utilisation, Germany is not in need of stimulus either - and this will remain the case with the revised forecasts that still foresee growth in line with potential. On the contrary, in the face of coming demographic challenges, costly stimulus measures could even backfire via negative confidence effects.Is the case for higher investment therefore completely without merit? No, but arguments in favour do not stem from cyclical considerations: they stem from structural considerations. Where Germany's growth potential is concerned, there is agreement that higher public investment does have a role to play.With regard to the size of the investment gap, however, there is probably no agreement. It is important that all investment measures are judged on a case-by-case basis, as we have seen in the past that not all public investment measures have been money well spent.And we should focus on shifting priorities in public expenditures. There is no need for a debt-financed fiscal stimulus, but for a structural shift of government expenditures from consumption to investment. Reforming the financial arrangements between the federal, the state, and the municipality level could encourage that shift.Somewhat more autonomy with regard to revenues might alleviate the problem of lacking funds to some extent. At the same time, however, it has to be ensured that the overall tax burden does not increase.Ladies and gentlemenThe reforms laid out so far, together with other widely discussed structural measures and sound public finances, would allow the euro-area economy to shift gears and accelerate. But they do not in themselves guarantee that the engine will run more smoothly and reliably.This is where reforms addressing the euro area's institutional architecture come in.The euro area teams up one common monetary policy with 18 national fiscal and economic policies. This approach reflects a currency area composed of sovereign member states. It grants member states sufficient leeway to preserve their diversity, that is to establish their own business models or to tailor institutions and policies to their own national preferences.At the same time, it leaves the consequences of such decisions with the respective member state and consistently rules out the option of mutualising public debt with other euro-area states.But this set-up also creates vulnerabilities.First, a combination of this kind gives rise to a deficit bias, as it allows the costs of fiscal imprudence to be shifted partially on to others. An unsustainable fiscal situation in one country has repercussions for monetary union as a whole.You can compare this to what economists call the “tragedy of the commons”. Just as overfishing creates negative externalities for other countries, excessive public debt harms the euro area as a whole. Excessive debt in one member state drives up longer-term interest rates for all euro-area countries.And second, each member state issues debt in a currency it cannot create. Thus, a high level of fiscal discipline is needed to ensure that solvency concerns do not spiral out of control.But the precautions taken in the Maastricht Treaty to ensure sound public finances have proven insufficient. The rules of the Stability and Growth Pact have been broken numerous times in the past, not least by Germany, France and Italy.And the no bail-out clause failed to exert the expected disciplining effect on governments in the run-up to the crisis, as markets did not take sufficient account of the different macroeconomic developments in the countries concerned.The rescue packages provided to countries which lost market access did help to contain an escalating crisis. But at the same time, they have thrown the balance between liability and control out of kilter. While spending decisions essentially remain a national prerogative, liability has become partially mutualised. The tendency to incur further debt is thus strengthened, not weakened. What is to be done?Some necessary steps have already been taken. The fiscal rules have been stiffened, with greater automaticity in the Stability and Growth Pact and the introduction of the fiscal compact.However, as we have learned from the crisis, rules can only be the first line of defence and they have to be applied to fulfil their purpose. Thus, the current debate in Italy and France about their fiscal stance is not reassuring. This underscores the need to buttress the rules with functioning market discipline.Sound public finances will only be achieved if we rigorously set about restoring the balance between liability and control. One way to do this would be a genuine fiscal union.If common debt were matched by common control, incentives could be aligned. But this would require a quantum leap in terms of ceding sovereignty to the European level, a leap neither the electorates nor the governments of the member states seem willing to take.If a true fiscal union that requires extensive changes to the European Treaties is not on the cards, then we need to take the second avenue. This avenue implies enhancing the original Maastricht framework that is based on the principle of individual responsibility.This principle requires that sovereigns, banks and investors bear the consequences of their decisions. We need to make sure that sovereign debt restructuring is possible without bringing down the financial system as a whole.To that end, more than three years ago the Bundesbank proposed automatically extending government bonds' maturity by, say, three years if the member state is granted financial support from the European Stability Mechanism. This would help to figure out if the country's problem is one of temporary illiquidity or insolvency.Additionally, doing away with the preferential treatment of sovereign debt in banks' balance sheets is of the essence. The current regulatory framework permits preferential treatment of sovereign exposures in various forms.While bank exposures to a single counterparty are limited, in principle, to a quarter of their eligible capital, exposures to sovereigns are exempted from that large exposures regime. Thus, many European banks hold bonds from one sovereign only - their home country. But a high level of undiversified sovereign exposure is what makes sovereign default a potentially systemic event. For this reason, the large exposures regime needs to apply to sovereigns as well.Moreover, sovereign exposures are privileged by low or zero capital requirements. An adequate risk-weighting of sovereign bonds would make banks more resilient if the fiscal position of the respective sovereign were to deteriorate. And it would bring spreads more into line with the underlying risk, thus sending a disciplining signal to the sovereign.If additional capital requirements for European banks were imposed to cover sovereign exposures, the additional capital would be rather small on aggregate - albeit with substantial differences between banks.The inclusion of sovereigns in the large exposures regime might lead to more substantial repercussions. But these would be manageable if introduced over a transition period - which, without question, has to be granted.Ladies and gentlemen, let me come to a close.The biggest bottleneck for growth in the euro area is not monetary policy, nor is it the lack of fiscal stimulus: it is the structural barriers that impede competition, innovation and productivity.If these barriers were torn down by all euro-area countries, the growth outlook would shift considerably - and this would instantly give rise to higher investment. Complementary reforms on the European level aimed at the services sector could provide a further boost. Taken together, these measures are expected to lift growth by as much as 15 percent above the current baseline level after ten years. To me, that sounds like a goal worth expanding some political capital to achieve, as do efforts to bring liability and control further into balance.The resolve the Latvian government showed in securing the joining of the euro has set a shining example in that regard - an example that reminds us of the collective efforts more than 750 years ago, and an example that can serve as a lodestar for the challenges of today.   ",2014-10-17,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-10-17,"Riga","Latvia","Wirtschaftstagung der Bank von Lettland 2014","Reforms for recovery and resilience",3195,19.1,5,43.5,11.9,"EN"
"2014-10-26 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","What we have just completed - a comprehensive balance sheet assessment and a tough stress test for the 130 largest banks in the euro area - can only be described as a tour de force. Dr Elke König has just presented the results of the exercise.I will now look ahead to the future. I will use the same metaphor which Dr König has already used, and which appears entirely appropriate here in Frankfurt today.While we are sitting here in this room, a couple of thousand people are still outside running the Frankfurt Marathon. A marathon is, without a doubt, an enormous challenge. And anyone who intends to run a marathon should first undergo a rigorous health check to find out whether he or she will even be physically up to the task.The comprehensive assessment was an extremely thorough check-up, including a demanding cardiac stress test. You now know the outcome: Germany's large banks are robust enough to withstand even severe stress.This is certainly an encouraging result, as for the banks, the marathon is only just beginning. Competition is becoming tougher and more international; regulation is becoming stricter, and supervision more European; in addition, the economic setting is challenging - think low-interest-rate environment - and technology is continuously evolving.Surviving and prevailing under these conditions is akin to a marathon. In addition, theoretically being able to withstand even severe stress will not automatically guarantee that the runner will finish the race. Even though he or she may be in very good shape at the starting line, the runner can still make many mistakes during the race. And, in future, there will be no more sovereign paramedics at the side of the road to help stumbling banks back on their feet.What the exercise conducted over the past 12 months has shown is that Germany's largest banks are able to withstand even severe stress. That will certainly help them to finish the marathon - but will not be enough to enable them to win it. That aim will require not only resilience but also the ability to outrun the competition - over a very long distance.And competition in the banking industry is becoming increasingly tougher and more international. Not only competition for customers, but also competition for investors. Global regulation and European supervision are creating an international level playing field in which investors will put their funds where the returns are greatest.German banks are therefore increasingly being forced to face international competition. And they are not performing all that well. In the current issue of its Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF notes that return on equity in the euro area is low compared with that in other regions such as the United States or Asia.German banks are underperforming the rest of Europe, too: in 2013 their return on equity, at 1.26 percent, and return on assets, at 0.06 percent, were both below the European average. A recent study has concluded that currently only 6 percent of Germany's banks even earn enough to cover their cost of capital.A business model which is relatively dependent on interest income is the main culprit for these weak earnings. In a protracted phase of very low interest rates, this imposes a particularly severe strain. At the same time, commission income and net trading income are insufficient to provide adequate compensation.Given these factors, German banks would be well advised to rethink their business models and to gear them towards the objective of sustainable profitability. However, the IMF sees Germany as being more towards the bottom of the international rankings with regard to overhauling business models.There is yet another important aspect to profitability: if the circuit is clogged with runners, they will get in each other's way. Mergers could therefore be beneficial, particularly in the German banking industry - the focus here should, of course, always remain on achieving a sustainable business model.To sum up: In the comprehensive assessment, German banks demonstrated that they are robust enough to withstand even severe stress but have to increase their profitability in order to cross the finishing line at the front of the pack.However, investors are not only interested in banks' profitability but also in their stability - and the same is true of us supervisors, of course. And when measuring a bank's stability, capital is still the crucial factor. The stress test has shown that German banks are sufficiently capitalised even in a very adverse scenario - after all, the German banks that were examined were found to have a common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 9.1 percent at the end of 2016 even in the adverse stress scenario.And we must not forget that this calculation is based on figures from the end of 2013. Since then, German banks have raised a total of €14.4 billion in CET1 capital. If this increase is taken into account in the stress test results, this gives the German banks that were examined a CET1 capital ratio of 9.94 percent as at the end of 2016. And that figure does not even include the capital measures taken in 2014 which do not count as CET1 capital.So the large German banks do not have any gaps in their risk-weighted capital ratios. Yet the markets and supervisors are also interested in the banks' unweighted capital ratios, of course. This metric, known as the leverage ratio, has improved among German banks over the past few months. Of the 25 banks that were examined, a total of 20 already fulfil the minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent which will apply from 2018 onwards under the Basel III regime. Even so, a cross-Europe comparison shows that German banks still have some catching-up to do.The markets look to the future, and banks need to do the same. None of the German banks should rest on their laurels because they have passed the stress test - to paraphrase a common German saying, after the stress test is before the stress test. That applies, above all, to those banks which only just made the grade. The markets and supervisors will be watching these banks particularly attentively in future.All in all, I consider the comprehensive assessment a success. It has helped to lift the veil of uncertainty that has surrounded the European banking system since the crisis. It has been a credible process, and one which will help to restore confidence in the banking sector and reassure the markets.But the comprehensive assessment is not the end of the road. The overall setting in which banks operate is changing, and they need to adapt - in Germany, Europe and around the world.Yet politicians must also play their part. The crisis has shown how dangerous an unstable banking system can be for the real economy. The most important step to address this issue is, of course, to improve regulation and supervision. That has been achieved.But especially in Europe it would be worthwhile to take measures to ease the real economy's access to alternative sources of funding. Some initial ideas on a European capital markets union are already being discussed; let's seize the opportunity to make these ideas a reality.So I should actually correct what I said at the beginning of my remarks. It isn't just the banks which are now standing at the starting line of a marathon - so are politicians.

I am happy to have the opportunity to officially thank the Bundesbank's departing representative, Winfried Liedtke, and to welcome his successor, Thomas Notheis.Allow me to say a few words on the roots of international cooperation. Not too long ago the saying was that when the United States sneezes, the world catches a cold. This is certainly still true, and the turbulence following the Federal Reserve's announcement of tapering was a case in point.However, the world economy of today is no longer a unipolar system. Take China as an example. China is now the second largest economy in the world, and the IMF estimates that, measured in purchasing power parities, China might have overtaken the United States in 2014 to become the world's largest economy.Thus, China is an important player on the global stage. According to IMF data, China accounted for more than one third of global economic growth in 2014. At the same time, it promotes growth in other parts of the world through trade linkages or direct investment. Over the past six years, Chinese imports grew by an average of 12 percent per annum while China's foreign direct investment reached a new record in 2013 with a total of more than US$ 100 billion.However, no one can deny that a global player can also be a global risk: when China sneezes, the world might catch a cold, too. Consequently, the IMF has recently warned that a hard landing in China might pose a risk to the world economy.Nevertheless, globalisation has not just taken us from a world economy that was dominated by one country to a world economy that is dominated by two countries. The world in which we live has become very small over the past decades. And in a small world, every policymaker in every country must be aware that his or her decisions can influence other countries as well.The world is interconnected by a close-knit network of trade relations and through a globalised financial system. Financial markets in particular have become integrated to such a degree that a small distortion at one end of the world can quickly spread and affect the entire system. In 2008, the failure of a single investment bank in the United States sparked a global financial crisis and a worldwide recession.Having acknowledged that financial crises today are global in scope, the G20 embarked on an ambitious agenda to reform global financial regulation. And they have made significant progress. The new Basel III rules will ensure that banks hold more and better capital. At the same time, new liquidity standards will ensure that banks have sound funding structures. These and other measures will make the global banking system more stable.However, there is always the other side of the coin: tougher rules for banks might lead to regulatory arbitrage where risky activities are shifted toward unregulated areas of the financial system. One current example is the growth of the shadow banking sector, where financial enterprises conduct business which creates bank-like risks but is either regulated insufficiently or not at all.The Financial Stability Board estimates that the assets of non-bank financial intermediaries grew by US$ 5 trillion in 2012 and now stand at US$ 71 trillion. Non-bank financial intermediaries represent about half of banking system assets and 117 percent of global GDP. And China is no exception here. According to the IMF, the size of the Chinese shadow banking sector has more than tripled since 2008 and reached 35 percent of GDP in March 2014. The IMFestimates that China has the fifth largest shadow banking sector in dollar terms among those jurisdictions which are members of the Financial Stability Board.A growing shadow banking sector is something regulators have to watch closely - not just in China but in other countries, too. Shadow banking participants undertake maturity and liquidity transformation, they engage in the transfer of credit risk, and they operate with leverage. This means they carry out a range of bank-like functions which are associated with bank-like risks.At the same time, however, there are two key differences compared to the regular banking system. First, shadow banking participants and activities are not subject to banking regulation. Second, shadow banking participants generally have no access to central bank liquidity, nor do they benefit from public backstops such as deposit insurance schemes.The consequence of this structure is a latent risk of runs on shadow banking participants. A run may lead to liquidity bottlenecks which can only be cleared by rapid deleveraging. That in turn may contribute to a collapse in prices on the financial markets, and thus exacerbate the problems in a procyclical fashion.In addition, the structure of many of the transactions conducted in the shadow banking system means that the participants are closely interconnected. Thus, contagion effects within the system are highly likely. These systemic risks within the shadow banking system may then spill over into the regular banking system, which is often directly or indirectly linked to the shadow banking system.Thus, the shadow banking system may well be a source of systemic risk. Accordingly, it is very high up on the G20 reform agenda. In this context, let me make one thing absolutely clear: the purpose of regulation is not to proscribe shadow banking activities or to drive participants out of the market when such activities and participants engender no systemic risk. The sole aim of regulation is to put a brake on systemic risk. We have certainly made some progress on this issue but we still have further to go.Because the growth of the shadow banking sector is a global issue, further cooperation is needed to make the financial system a safer place. And international cooperation always starts at the personal level, with personal relations forming the root of successful cooperation. This is where our representatives here in Beijing come into play. Their task is to build networks, to share information and ideas, to explain the Bundesbank's positions and to facilitate cooperation.For the past three years, Winfried Liedtke has served as the Bundesbank's representative in Beijing.

I strongly believe that our presence here in Beijing will deepen friendship and cooperation, not only between Thomas Notheis and his peers but also between the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Central Bank of China, and eventually between Germany and China.Thank you, Consul General Siebert, for hosting this event here at your residence. I am happy to have the opportunity to officially thank the Bundesbank's outgoing representative, Thomas Notheis, and to welcome his successor, Alexander Sattler.Allow me to say a few words on the roots of international cooperation. Not too long ago, the saying was that when the United States sneezes, the world catches a cold. This is certainly still true, and the turbulence following the Federal Reserve's announcement of tapering was a case in point.However, we have reached a point where the health of the world economy is not just determined by the state of the US economy. The world in which we live has become very small over recent decades. And, in a small world, every policymaker in every country must be aware that his or her decisions can influence other countries as well.The world is interconnected by a close-knit network of trade relations and via a globalised financial system. Financial markets in particular have become integrated to such a degree that a small distortion at one end of the world can quickly spread and affect the entire system. In 2008, the failure of a single investment bank in the United States caused a global financial crisis and a worldwide recession.Such banks are usually referred to as too big to fail. They are woven so deeply into the fabric of the financial system that their failure can tear everything apart. Consequently, when push comes to shove, governments are compelled to bail out these banks to avoid a systemic crisis. This adds up to an implicit and cost-free insurance for large banks, which sets all the wrong incentives.Thus, tackling the too big to fail-problem is paramount to create a stable financial system. This is a well-established fact that has also been acknowledged by India. From 2015 onwards, a number of Indian banks will be classified as domestically systemically important. Nevertheless, banks that are too big to fail pose a problem that is global in scope and has to be resolved not only at the national but also at the global level.The Financial Stability Board is currently finalising criteria that global systemically important banks will have to fulfil in future regarding their capital structure. In particular, they will need a minimum amount of loss-absorbing capacity. This will allow for an orderly resolution of those banks and protect taxpayers from having to foot the bill.Another major step towards remedying the too big to fail-problem has been taken with regard to cross-border resolution. Recently, 18 global banks and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreed to implement new rules on derivatives trading. Whenever a large bank fails, these rules will allow authorities to temporarily suspend the rights of other banks to terminate derivatives contracts. This will buy precious time to organise an orderly resolution of the failed bank.While these steps certainly bring us closer to resolving the too big to fail-problem, there is still further to go. Thus, further cooperation on this and on other issues is necessary to make the financial system a safer place over time. International cooperation always starts at the personal level, with personal relations forming the root of successful cooperation. This is where our representatives here in Mumbai come into play. Their task is to build networks, to share information and ideas, to explain the Bundesbank's positions and to facilitate cooperation.For the past four years, Thomas Notheis has served as the Bundesbank's representative here in Mumbai. There is no doubt that he has had a challenging job: as he was our first representative in India, he could not draw on existing experience and had to build up a network from scratch. Judging from the distinguished crowd gathered here today, he has done an excellent job. I would therefore like to thank him personally and on behalf of the Bundesbank for his service here in Mumbai.Given the excellent job that Thomas Notheis has done in Mumbai, I am particularly happy that he is taking his experience and skills to another post abroad. For the next three years, he will serve as the Bundesbank's representative in Beijing. But coming back to Mumbai, I would also like to take the opportunity to welcome our new representative, Alexander Sattler.Before joining the Bundesbank, he previously worked as a policy advisor at GIZ, the German Federal Government's agency for international development cooperation. Furthermore, with his background in both economics and political science, he worked most recently as an expert in the Bundesbank's International Monetary Affairs Division, dealing in particular with global financial stability issues relating to the International Monetary Fund. Some of you have already met him, and I am certain that he will be a worthy successor to Thomas Notheis.One final thought I would like to leave you with: our decision to have a permanent representative here in Mumbai shows that the Bundesbank acknowledges the importance of the Indian economy and the role of its financial market in Asia and the rest of the world. I strongly believe that our presence here in Mumbai will deepen friendship and cooperation, not only between Alexander Sattler and his peers but also between the Bundesbank and the Reserve Bank of India, and eventually between Germany and India.",2014-10-30,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-10-30,"Mumbai","India","Farewell to Thomas Notheis","The ""too big to fail""-problem and the roots of international cooperation",887,20.6,5,43.4,12.3,"EN"
"2014-11-04 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","ich freue mich, heute an der Ruhr-Universität Bochum zu sein. Im Jahr 1962 hat die Ruhr-Universität als erste neugegründete Universität der Bundesrepublik eine Pionierrolle eingenommen. Und eine ähnliche Pionierrolle nimmt mit dem heutigen Tag die EZB ein. Sie ist ab dem heutigen Dienstag für die direkte Aufsicht über die größten Banken des Euro-Raums zuständig. Allerdings hoffe ich nicht, dass der EZB, so wie damals der Ruhr-Universität, noch weitere Neugründungen folgen werden.Heute beginnt also eine europäische Zeitrechnung für die Bankenaufsicht. Ich übertreibe wohl nicht, wenn ich die europäische Bankenaufsicht als das ehrgeizigste europäische Projekt seit Einführung des Euro bezeichne. Für mich ist ihre Errichtung ein ebenso notwendiger wie logischer Schritt. Eine einheitliche Geldpolitik braucht integrierte Finanzmärkte und dazu gehört auch eine gemeinsame Bankenaufsicht. Doch die europäische Bankenaufsicht ist nur der erste Schritt. Ziel ist es, eine ganze Bankenunion zu errichten. Und diese Bankenunion ruht auf zwei Säulen: auf der europäischen Bankenaufsicht und auf einem europäischen Abwicklungsmechanismus für Banken. Die erste Säule errichten wir heute, die zweite Säule wird Anfang 2016 errichtet.Bevor wir nun über die neue europäische Bankenaufsicht im Einzelnen sprechen, lassen Sie uns einen kurzen Blick zurück werfen.Die Bankenunion soll mehrere Schwachstellen beheben, die in der Finanzkrise offensichtlich wurden. Dazu gehören zum Beispiel unterschiedliche nationalen Aufsichtspraktiken sowie eine ungenügende grenzüberschreitende Kooperation der Aufseher, vor allem bei der Aufsicht über Großbanken, die ja meist in mehreren Ländern gleichzeitig aktiv sind. Gleichzeitig fehlten Instrumente, um solche Großbanken im Notfall abzuwickeln - entsprechend mussten gerade in der jüngsten Krise immer wieder die Steuerzahler für die Kosten von Bankenpleiten aufkommen. Die Bankenunion soll an diesen Schwachstellen ansetzen.Erst vor einem Jahr, im November 2013, einigte sich der europäische Gesetzgeber auf die Rechtsgrundlage für die gemeinsame europäische Aufsicht. Seit dieser Einigung haben alle Beteiligten einen enormen Kraftakt hinter sich gebracht, als dessen Ergebnis die EZB heute die Bankenaufsicht für die 120 bedeutendsten Banken des Euro-Raums übernimmt.Das größte Vorbereitungsprojekt war das sogenannte Comprehensive Assessment der Banken, bestehend aus einem Bilanzcheck und einem Stresstest. Ziel war es, noch vor dem Start der europäischen Bankenaufsicht Altlasten in den Bankbilanzen aufzudecken und zu beseitigen. So sollte der europäischen Bankenaufsicht ein unbeschwerter Start ermöglicht werden.Die deutschen Banken haben im Comprehensive Assessmentnachgewiesen, dass sie auch großen Belastungen gewachsen sind. Der Stresstest hat gezeigt, dass die deutschen Banken auch in einem sehr adversen Stress-Szenario ausreichend kapitalisiert sind - mit einer harten Kernkapitalquote von 9,1 Prozent.Allerdings sollte man nicht nur auf die harte Kernkapitalquote schauen, die ja auf Basis der risikogewichteten Aktiva berechnet wird. Die Märkte und auch die Aufsicht nehmen zusätzlich auch die ungewichtete Eigenkapitalquote unter die Lupe, also den Verschuldungsgrad der Banken. Diese Leverage Ratio hat sich bei den deutschen Banken durchaus verbessert: Von den 25 untersuchten Banken erfüllen insgesamt 20 bereits heute die Vorgabe zur Leverage Ratio von 3 Prozent, die nach den Basel-III Regeln ab 2018 gelten soll. Im europäischen Vergleich aber schneiden die deutschen Banken bei der Leverage Ratio dennoch vergleichsweise schlecht ab. Hier gibt es also Nachholbedarf.Insgesamt hat das Comprehensive Assessment eine bisher noch nie dagewesene Transparenz geschaffen. Das Comprehensive Assessment hat einen tiefen und glaubwürdigen Einblick in die Zustand des europäischen Bankensystems geliefert - sowohl für die Aufsicht als auch für den Markt. Noch nie zuvor gab es eine so umfassende Analyse des europäischen Bankensystems nach einheitlichen Kriterien. Damit wird das Comprehensive Assessmentdazu beitragen, das Vertrauen in das europäische Bankensystem wiederherzustellen.Mit dem Start der europäischen Bankenaufsicht geht die direkte Aufsicht über die 120 bedeutendsten Banken des Euro-Raums an die EZB über. Für uns in Deutschland bedeutet das dreierlei: Erstens geben wir bei 21 deutschen Banken zwar die direkte Aufsichtsverantwortung an die EZB ab, stellen aber weiterhin deren laufende Aufsicht sicher; zweitens werden BaFin und Bundesbank weiterhin die übrigen rund 2.000 deutschen Kreditinstitute direkt beaufsichtigen; drittens werden wir an der Aufsicht über 99 ausländische Banken beteiligt, die von nun an der europäischen Aufsicht unterliegen.Diejenigen Banken, die ab heute unter der direkten Aufsicht der EZB stehen, werden von sogenannten Joint Supervisory Teams beaufsichtigt. Geleitet werden diese Teams zwar von EZB-Mitarbeitern, in den Teams arbeiten aber auch Mitarbeiter der Bundesbank und der BaFin - und zwar nicht nur bei den 21 deutschen Banken, sondern auch bei den 99 ausländischen. Die Aufgaben und der Blickwinkel der nationalen Aufsicht haben sich also deutlich erweitert. Die nationalen Aufseher verfügen über große Erfahrung, die sie in die Joint Supervisory Teamseinbringen. Gleichzeitig werden die Aufseher Erkenntnisse, die sie im Rahmen der europäischen Aufsicht gewinnen, in die nationale Aufsichtspraxis mit einfließen lassen. Damit haben wir die einmalige Möglichkeit, eine schlagkräftige Aufsicht zu bilden - sowohl auf nationaler als auch auf europäischer Ebene.Meine Damen und Herren, Aristoteles hat gesagt: Wir können den Wind nicht ändern, aber wir können die Segel richtig setzen. Mit der Krise hat sich der Wind ohne Frage geändert, und mit der europäischen Bankenaufsicht haben wir begonnen, die Segel richtig zu setzen.Aber sowohl für uns als Aufseher als auch für die Banken bleiben Herausforderungen bestehen. Für die Aufsicht und die Politik denke ich dabei an zwei Dinge: Erstens müssen wir die europäische Bankenaufsicht um den europäischen Abwicklungsmechanismus erweitern - aus dem Einmaster muss ein Zweimaster werden; zweitens müssen wir noch am Kiel, also dem Fundament der Bankenunion, arbeiten.Der europäische Abwicklungsmechanismus ist ganz entscheidend für die Stabilität des europäischen Finanzsystems. Der Grundgedanke dabei ist, dass auch eine noch so gute Aufsicht nicht verhindern kann, dass einzelne Banken scheitern. Und das sollte sie auch nicht verhindern, denn die Grundlage einer funktionierenden Marktwirtschaft ist das Scheitern. Der Ökonom Allan Meltzer hat gesagt: Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin - it does not work.Die Möglichkeit des Scheiterns setzt den Banken Anreize, möglichst nachhaltig und risikobewusst zu wirtschaften. Allerdings hat die Finanzkrise eins gezeigt: Wenn eine große und vernetzte Bank scheitert, kann sie das gesamte Finanzsystem erschüttern. Denken Sie an den Konkurs von Lehman Brothers, der die globale Finanzkrise ausgelöst hat. Solche systemrelevanten Banken konnten sich daher darauf verlassen, dass ihnen im Notfall der Staat zur Seite springt, um eine Systemkrise zu vermeiden.Diese Banken haben also eine implizite und kostenlose staatliche Versicherung. Und das setzt natürlich genau die falschen Anreize - aus Sicht der Banken haben wir eine Situation des capitalism without failure. In der Wissenschaft und in der Politik wird dieses Problem unter dem Stichwort too big to fail diskutiert. Und um es zu lösen, ist die Möglichkeit einer geordneten Abwicklung von Banken entscheidend.Vor diesem Hintergrund wurden auf globaler Ebene einige Grundprinzipien zur Abwicklung systemrelevanter Banken entwickelt. Auf dieser Grundlage wiederum hat die EU in einer Richtlinie harmonisierte Abwicklungsregeln für alle Institute festgesetzt. Entscheidend ist die Frage der Haftung. In Zukunft stehen die Eigentümer und Gläubiger ganz vorne in der Reihe, wenn es darum geht, die Kosten einer Bankenschieflage zu tragen. Die Steuerzahler dagegen stehen, wenn überhaupt, erst ganz am Ende der Reihe.Diese Regeln spiegeln sich im Euro-Raum im europäischen Abwicklungsmechanismus wider, der 2016 als zweiter Mast der Bankenunion errichtet wird. Faktisch wird dieser Mechanismus allerdings nur für diejenigen Banken gelten, die direkt von der EZBbeaufsichtigt werden. Alle übrigen Institute werden auch künftig national abgewickelt. Diese Regelung halte ich für sinnvoll, da die Abwicklung kleinerer Banken in der Regel keine europäische Dimension hat.Ich bin überzeugt, dass die Bankenunion ab 2016 mit ihren beiden Masten sicher segeln kann. Aber auch dann ist es wichtig, dass der Kiel der Bankenunion nicht auf Grund läuft. Das ist für mich die zweite Herausforderung, und hier ist die Politik gefragt.Es geht vor allem darum, ein Gleichgewicht von Haftung und Kontrolle zu finden. Nehmen Sie als Beispiel eine gemeinsame europäische Einlagensicherung, die gelegentlich als möglicher dritter Mast der Bankenunion diskutiert wird. Auf dem bisherigen Kiel können wir diesen nicht errichten.Eine europäische Einlagensicherung würde bedeuten, dass alle Länder gemeinsam haften. Das aber würde auch eine gemeinsame Kontrolle erfordern. Der aktuelle Rechtsrahmen in der EU lässt das aber nicht zu. Daher wird eine europäische Einlagensicherung zurzeit nicht weiter verfolgt; stattdessen sollen zunächst nationale Sicherungsfonds harmonisiert werden. Ich halte es für richtig, sich hier Zeit zu lassen.Zum anderen ist neben dem Gleichlauf von Haftung und Kontrolle die Rechtsgrundlage ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Kiels, auf dem die Bankenunion segelt. Damit die Bankenunion nicht auf Grund läuft, scheint mir eine solide primärrechtliche Grundlage erforderlich.Viele Aufgaben im Rahmen der Bankenunion sind ohne eine entsprechende Änderung der europäischen Verträge rechtlich nicht oder nur unzulänglich durchzuführen. So sollte die europäische Bankenaufsicht in ihrer jetzigen Form als Übergangslösung betrachtet werden. In diesem Zusammenhang muss auch über die klare institutionelle Trennung von Geldpolitik und Bankenaufsicht in Europa diskutiert werden. Die Konflikte sind vorprogrammiert, wenn man die EZB als Notenbank des Eurosystems in die Rolle der Eier legenden Wollmilchsau drängt, wie es der ehemalige Präsident der Bundesbank, Axel Weber, formuliert hat.Lassen Sie uns zum Abschluss noch einmal von der Bankenaufsicht zu den Banken selbst zurückkehren. Das Comprehensive Assessments hat den deutschen Banken ein gutes Zeugnis ausgestellt und gezeigt, dass diese selbst starken Belastungen gewachsen sind. Viele Banken haben enorme Anstrengungen unternommen, sich von Altlasten zu befreien und sich effizienter aufzustellen. Dabei haben sie vor allem ihre Kapitalbasis gestärkt. Für einige Banken lautet die Note aber lediglich versetzt; von den Klassenbesten sind sie noch weit entfernt.Doch letztlich müssen sich alle Banken für die Herausforderungen der Zukunft widmen. Die globale Regulierungsreform und die europäische Aufsicht schaffen ein international gleichmäßiges Spielfeld. Das wird sicherlich dazu führen, dass sich auch die deutschen Banken einem zunehmend internationalen Wettbewerb stellen müssen. Und hier müssen sie härter am Wind segeln.Allerdings schneiden viele europäische und auch deutsche Banken im internationalen Vergleich nicht so gut ab. So ist nach dem aktuellen Finanzstabilitätsbericht des IWF die Eigenkapitalrendite im Euro-Raum relativ gering - vor allem im Vergleich zu den USAoder Asien. Gleichzeitig schneiden die deutschen Banken selbst im europäischen Vergleich unterdurchschnittlich ab. So lagen sie im Jahr 2013 mit einer Eigenkapitalrendite von 1,26 Prozent und einer Gesamtkapitalrendite von 0,06 Prozent unter dem Durchschnitt des Euro-Raums.Eine Ursache für diese Ertragsschwäche ist das relativ zinsabhängige Geschäftsmodell deutscher Banken, das durch die anhaltende Phase niedriger Zinsen belastet wird. Auch die Provisions- und Handelsergebnisse der deutschen Banken können den Gesamtertrag nicht wesentlich verbessern. Gleichzeitig scheint die Ertragsschwäche deutscher Banken nicht aus zu hohen Kosten zu resultieren. Hier sind deutsche Institute international durchaus wettbewerbsfähig.Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es an der Zeit, dass die deutschen Banken ihre Geschäftsmodelle überdenken und auf das Ziel nachhaltiger Ertragsstärke ausrichten. Um die Ertragssituation zu verbessern, könnten sie zum Beispiel nicht-volatile Ertragsquellen aus dem Provisionsgeschäft stärken - etwa im Bereich Zahlungsverkehr oder dem Vermittlungsgeschäft. Gleichzeitig sollten schwache Geschäftsbereiche abgebaut werden. Auch Fusionen oder ein Schrumpfen des Marktes dürfen keine Tabuthemen sein.Mit Blick auf die Geschäftsmodelle wird sich mit der europäischen Bankenaufsicht einiges ändern: So ist davon auszugehen, dass die EZB bei den von ihr beaufsichtigten Banken regelmäßig Geschäftsmodelle prüfen wird. Das ist in den USA, Großbritannien und Irland eine übliche Praxis, für die deutschen Institute aber ein Novum. Zwar können die Aufseher den Banken nicht vorschreiben, die Geschäftsmodelle zu ändern. Haben sie aber Zweifel am Geschäftsmodell einer Bank, so können sie zumindest mehr Eigenkapital und Liquidität vorschreiben. Ich denke, das ist ein gutes Beispiel dafür, wie eine europäische Aufsicht das Beste aus verschiedenen nationalen Aufsichtspraktiken aufnehmen und anwenden kann.Meine Damen und Herren, die Segel für eine europäische Aufsicht sind gesetzt. Trotzdem ist das Boot der Bankenunion auch nach dem geglückten Stapellauf noch nicht ganz fertig. Mit dem europäischen Abwicklungsmechanismus muss noch ein zweiter Mast errichtet werden.Dennoch sind wir in den vergangenen Monaten sehr viele Meilen gesegelt und haben Strecke gut gemacht. Ich bin zuversichtlich, dass die Arbeit der EZB als neuer Kapitän der europäischen Bankenaufsicht ein Erfolg wird. Die Segel sind jedenfalls richtig gesetzt, und so können wir auch ungemütlicheres Wetter sicherer durchsegeln als jemals zu vor.",2014-11-04,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-11-04,"Bochum","Germany","Ruhr-Universität Bochum","Der Startschuss ist gefallen - Die neue europäische Bankenaufsicht",1957,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DE"
"2014-11-07 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you very much for inviting me to speak here at the 60th Kreditpolitische Tagung. I wish to begin by congratulating you on this landmark birthday. The future of the banking industry is the topic of today's conference and also of my remarks. But please join me on a brief digression before we come to the topic of the banking industry.Have you ever heard of the US baseball player Yogi Berra? Yogi Berra is a household name in the United States - not just for his achievements as a ballplayer, but also for his aphorisms. One of these aphorisms referred to the future: he is supposed to have once said that: The future ain't what it used to be. With respect to the banking industry, probably nobody could have put it better.We have left behind us a severe crisis, which for most of us - myself included - was, and will hopefully remain a once-only event. This crisis set in motion a process which will change the financial system from the ground up. It is therefore all the more important that we look towards the future and give some thought to where this process will take us. The topic of today's conference is thus entirely appropriate.I will confine my remarks to the viewpoint of supervisors and regulators, whereas the other speakers will probably take different perspectives. Regulation and supervision form the framework for the banking industry and its future - which is why I have chosen to focus on these factors.Quite soon after the crisis broke out, initial steps were taken at the global level to improve banking regulation.Without going into further detail, let me mention two extremely decisive measures. One was that the capital rules were tightened. This is an appropriate step, since capital is still the most complete buffer a bank can hold to cover losses. For globally systemically important banks, we even went a step further. These banks now have to hold additional loss-absorbing instruments above and beyond capital.Secondly we also - for the first time ever - adopted global liquidity standards alongside the new capital regime. This is also an appropriate step, for the recent crisis was driven strongly by liquidity problems. At the end of October, the Basel Committee published its final rules, which will place banks' funding on a more stable basis.The regulatory reform will help make banks more stable. However, it entails effort and costs - something which particularly the banks themselves point out time and again. It is certainly true that tighter bank regulation is a cost factor. However, regulation is not an end in itself; it is there to prevent crises. So if we want to discuss the costs of regulation to banks, we also have to talk about the costs of crises to the taxpayer - and then I do believe indeed that the figures add up.The regulatory reform will undoubtedly affect the future of the banking industry. Though it might mean more time and effort for one bank or another in the short run, for society it means more stability in the long run - which will also benefit, not least, the banks themselves.However, regulation only defines the rules of the game. An additional element is needed - a referee to monitor compliance with the rules.In this regard, we in Europe set out into a new world three days ago. On 4 November, the ECB assumed responsibility for supervising the 120 largest banks in the euro area. These 120 banks represent more than 80 percent of the euro-area banking system's total assets. This turned the ECB overnight into one of the world's largest supervisory authorities.The new Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in Europe is getting to the root of three causes of the recent crisis. For it enables banks to be supervised at a consistently high standard throughout the euro area; it allows cross-border problems to be handled better; and it contributes to mitigating the influence of national interests, which has time and again hampered arm's-length supervision.The step towards a European prudential supervisory regime certainly represented upheaval for the supervised banks. The supervisory culture will change: supervision will become more quantitative, and its perspective will change. Thus, in future the ECB will also inspect banks' business models. While this is standard practice in countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom, it is a first for German banks. It will certainly not be easy, but it is worth trying.The SSM, however, will naturally follow the principle of proportionality: systemically important banks and banks with riskier business models will be supervised more closely than small banks and banks with low-risk business models.The process of change associated with the SSM, by the way, will affect not only the banks but also us as supervisors. However, even in the new supervisory world order, the Bundesbank and BaFin will still be closely involved in off-site supervision.The SSM will give national supervisors the opportunity to acquire new experience, which they can then transfer to supervision of the nearly 2,000 German banks for which national supervisors will remain responsible. The step towards an SSM for Europe will therefore affect all banks, and all banks will benefit.To sum up: we have improved regulation and supervision alike. This will make the future of the banking system more stable and less crisis-prone.However, I already hinted at the beginning that supervision and regulation are not just for banks but particularly for society at large. Within the regulatory framework and under supervisors' watchful eye, banks will have to look out for themselves in future, too. This is all the more so as, in future, sovereigns will no longer be around to rescue banks in an emergency with taxpayers' money. This is due to the new bail-in rules for shareholders and creditors and to the new European resolution mechanism which will take effect in 2016.Regulatory reform is thus putting more market into the financial markets - and with markets also comes the possibility of failure. In the words of economist Allan Meltzer: Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin - it doesn't work.In future, it will be up to the banks themselves to hold their own in the market. And for this they need two factors: stability and profitability. Regulation and supervision can at least contribute to stability; however, banks themselves are responsible for profitability.Where does the German banking system stand with respect to stability and profitability? Not quite two weeks ago, the ECBpublished the results of the comprehensive assessment. In this exercise, the 130 most significant euro-area banks were subjected to a thorough health check - with regard to the quality of their assets as well as to their resilience to a possible economic downturn.The exercise identified capital shortfalls at a total of 25 banks in Europe. Twelve of these banks already closed the capital shortfalls this year, while the other 13 now have nine months to remedy their shortfalls. This should take place primarily through genuine capital increases, ie not by reducing their risk-weighted assets and especially not using public funds - a particularly important point, in my book.The 25 German banks passed the comprehensive assessment, with one exception. The bank that failed has already closed the identified capital shortfall, however. Incidentally, a total of five German banks would have failed the test if the Basel III capital definitions which enter into force from 2018 had been applied.Like with any test, among those banks which passed the test, some passed with good marks and others only just scraped through. It is above all those banks which just barely passed which can expect to be monitored particularly closely in future - by supervisors and by the markets. Ultimately, however, for all banks, this is absolutely not the time for complacency. The real work is only just beginning.For investors and supervisors are, of course, looking beyond the results of the comprehensive assessment. Take, for example, the unweighted capital ratio, that is to say, banks' leverage ratio. Despite improvements of late, it is still well below the European average - and this goes particularly for the large, internationally active German banks. There is thus a need to catch up.The same also applies to German banks' profitability. Competition for customers and investors will become much tougher in future, and at the same time more international. Global regulation and European supervision will level the playing field on an international scale. German banks are therefore increasingly being forced to face international competition. And an international comparison shows that German banks do indeed have catching-up to do with respect to profitability.Their return on equity and return on assets were both well below the European average in 2013. One driver of German banks' sluggish earnings is that their business models depend relatively heavily on interest income.In a protracted period of low interest rates, this naturally weighs on earnings. In the first half of this year, the large German banks' operating income was down roughly 8 percent from the previous year - a decline driven by falling net interest income. The problem we are dealing with here is ultimately structural: one can see that interest rate margins have been on a continuous slide since the mid-1980s. This has been affecting, in particular, the major banks in Germany, including the Landesbanken.Therefore, in order to be ready for the future, banks should rethink their business models and orient them to sustainable profitability. The need to reorient business models is not specific to Germany: however, here, too, German banks are performing somewhat below par by international standards. At least this is what the IMF has diagnosed in its recent Global Financial Stability Report.It would make sense for the banks to pursue a strategy of diversifying sources of income and, in particular, of expanding sources of non-interest income. The good news is that in terms of costs, German banks are still performing relatively well by international standards. However, many areas remain where banks' profitability could be enhanced indirectly.The branch networks of cooperative sector banks are still quite extensive. Although it serves to acquire and maintain customers, it is also a large cost component when compared with competing direct banks.  Although the total number of banks in Germany has already been declining for some time, the German banking market continues to be relatively dense and has room for consolidation.Against this background, all ideas need to be considered. Mergers must not be off-limits, either - provided these are between strong partners and preserve sustainable business models. Incidentally, as I mentioned earlier, supervisors will also be keeping an eye on business models. However, supervisors are, of course, not the better bankers. The final decision on business models should ultimately be taken by those who are being paid to do it and ultimately bear the risk.Ladies and gentlemen, each bank has the power to shape its future. However, each bank is dependent on its economic environment. At the outbreak of the crisis, US banks suffered much more greatly than European banks, but they then also made a much faster recovery. This is not least because the US economy also stabilised relatively quickly. Looking at Europe, politicians are now called upon to undertake the necessary reforms: reforms for growth and reforms for stability. For only in a healthy economy can banks generate sustainable profits. This has always been so, and it will always be that way in future.However, not only are banks dependent on the economy - but also, of course, vice versa.  A modern economy depends on a functioning banking system.I have spent the past 20 minutes talking about the challenges for the future - but the future is naturally also open to wishes, especially now with Christmas approaching. My greatest wish is for the banking industry to return to its inherent role: as a provider of services to the real economy.What we need is genuine cultural change which will re-ingrain this image in the minds of bankers. A culture in which anything goes unless explicitly forbidden must not be allowed to be part of the future but should instead be banished to the past. We need a culture based on a quote from Seneca: Shame may restrain what the law does not prohibit.Of course it was, in the end, only a few black sheep who gave an entire industry a bad name. However, we need a culture that transcends short-term yields to look at the bigger picture. Banks have a responsibility to the economy and to society. Once they fulfil this responsibility, they will regain public confidence.Ladies and gentlemen, the world of banks is changing. In my remarks, I have discussed various factors affecting the German banking industry's path to the future. These include stricter regulation and European supervision, but also tougher competition.And it is not just competition within the banking market which is playing a role. Technological progress is also creating competition entering the banking market from without. Take, for instance, new electronic payment systems or crowdfunding. These are putting external pressure on banks' traditional business models. Banks need to respond and to adapt their business models and ITsystems to the new environment.It is ultimately up to the banking industry to decide how far they wish to go in this situation. I am convinced that German banks have what it takes to prevail in future, as well, but they already have to begin today to address the challenges of tomorrow. We cannot regulate the banking industry's path to a golden future; this is where banks must assume a great deal of individual responsibility.Let me close my remarks by quoting, alongside Yogi Berra, another famous American: Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future. These words were spoken by John F Kennedy.",2014-11-07,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-11-07,"Frankfurt","Germany","60.

"2014-11-12 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","ich freue mich, heute zu Ihnen zu sprechen und mit Ihnen zu diskutieren.Meine Rede beginnt vor knapp viereinhalb Jahren, am 2. Mai 2010. An diesem Tag haben sich die EU-Finanzminister darauf geeinigt, dem strauchelnden Griechenland mit einem Rettungspaket im Umfang von 110 Mrd € unter die Arme zu greifen. Eine Woche darauf, am 10. Mai 2010, beschloss die EZB den Ankauf von Staatsanleihen, um die Finanzmärkte zu stabilisieren – eine Entscheidung, die von der Bundesbank kritisiert wurde.Im Rückblick lässt sich mit Fug und Recht behaupten, dass diese erste Mai-Woche im Jahr 2010 wahrhaft turbulent war. Viele sehen in ihr sogar den offiziellen Beginn der Euro-Krise. Mir sind damals zwei Dinge klar geworden.Erstens unterschätzten viele Beobachter außerhalb Europas – vor allem in den USA – den politischen Willen in Europa, die Währungsunion zusammenzuhalten. Zweitens überschätzten viele Beobachter innerhalb Europas – unter anderem ich selbst – die Stabilität des institutionellen Rahmens des Euro-Raums.Welche Schlussfolgerung können wir aus diesen beiden Einsichten ziehen? Die Schlussfolgerung lautet, dass wir uns den offensichtlich vorhandenen politischen Willen zunutze machen müssen, um den institutionellen Rahmen des Euro-Raums zu stärken. Doch auf welche Weise?Nach meiner Auffassung lautet das Schlüsselwort hierfür Integration. Sicherlich weist die politische Landschaft Europas inzwischen eine Reihe von Parteien auf, die auf einer Welle von Euroskepsis und Anti-Euro-Rhetorik reiten. Das ist eine beunruhigende Entwicklung. Trotzdem sind die politischen Entscheidungsträger und die Mehrheit der Menschen in ganz Europa noch immer von der Idee eines vereinten Europas überzeugt.Vom ökonomischen Standpunkt aus gesehen könnte eine tiefere Integration dazu beitragen, den Rahmen der Währungsunion zu stärken. Lassen Sie uns drei Bereiche betrachten, in denen eine weitere Integration den Weg weisen könnte.Der erste Bereich sind die öffentlichen Finanzen. Um den Kern meines Arguments zu verstehen, muss man mit den Besonderheiten der Europäischen Währungsunion vertraut sein. Die Europäische Währungsunion stellt insofern einen Sonderfall dar, als sie eine europäische Geldpolitik mit nationalen Haushaltspolitiken verbindet.Die Geldpolitik für die 18 Euro-Länder legt der EZB-Rat in Frankfurt fest. Die Haushaltspolitiken der 18 Euro-Länder liegt dagegen in den Händen der Länder selbst: Die Regierung eines jeden Landes entscheidet eigenständig über ihre öffentlichen Einnahmen und Ausgaben.Dieses Ungleichgewicht der Verantwortlichkeiten bietet den einzelnen Ländern einen Anreiz, sich zu verschulden. Unser Ziel sollte es sein, dieser Defizitneigung entgegenzuwirken, um eine stabile Währungsunion sicherzustellen. Dies gelingt nur, wenn wir die Verantwortlichkeiten neu ausbalancieren: Haftung und Kontrolle müssen im Gleichgewicht sein.Ein Weg, dieses Gleichgewicht herzustellen, besteht in einer tieferen Integration. Wenn wir diesen Weg gingen, würden bestimmte Kontrollrechte über die nationalen Haushalte auf die europäische Ebene verlagert. Dieser Ansatz liefe auf eine sogenannte Fiskalunion hinaus. Voraussetzung für einen solchen Schritt wäre jedoch, dass die Euro-Länder nationale Souveränität auf die europäische Ebene übertragen würden, etwa indem diese Ebene im Falle unsolider öffentlicher Finanzen ein Eingriffsrecht erhielte.Ein derartiger Souveränitätsverzicht wäre ein grundlegender Kurswechsel und würde weitreichende legislative Veränderungen auf nationaler wie auch auf europäischer Ebene erfordern. Vor allem wäre dafür neben der Unterstützung durch die politischen Entscheidungsträger auch eine Unterstützung durch die Bevölkerung notwendig. Doch hier müssen wir realistisch sein: Ich kann derzeit keine Bereitschaft für einen derartigen Schritt erkennen – weder in Deutschland noch in irgendeinem anderen Land des Euro-Raums.Für die absehbare Zukunft bedeutet dies, dass die Kontrolle der Finanzpolitik in Europa auf der nationalen Ebene verbleiben wird. In diesem Bereich liegt eine tiefere Integration somit noch jenseits des Horizonts.Doch wenn der heutige Zustand einer etwas schlagseitigen Integration die Oberhand behält, muss die nationale Ebene auch für ihre eigene Politik haften. Dies würde bedeuten, dass wir die aktuellen Verschuldungsregeln stärken: den Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt. Diese Regeln wurden mittlerweile verschärft – jetzt gilt es, sie anzuwenden und ihre Einhaltung sicherzustellen.Meine Damen und Herren, zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt ist eine Fiskalunion nach wie vor eher eine Vision als ein konkreter Plan. Auf einem anderen Gebiet ist Europa jedoch vergangene Woche einen großen Schritt in Richtung einer stärkeren Integration gegangen.Am 4. November hat die EZB die direkte Aufsicht über die 120 größten Banken im Euro-Raum übernommen. Damit haben wir den ersten Pfeiler einer europäischen Bankenunion errichtet. Die 120 Banken, die unter die Aufsicht der EZB fallen, machen mehr als 80 Prozent der aggregierten Bilanz des Bankensektors im Euro-Raum aus. Die EZB ist also quasi über Nacht zu einem der größten Bankenaufseher der Welt geworden.Die europäische Bankenaufsicht ist sicherlich der größte Schritt auf dem Weg zur Finanzmarktintegration in Europa seit der Einführung unserer gemeinsamen Währung. Und meiner Meinung nach ist sie auch der logischste Schritt, den es zu vollziehen gilt. Eine einheitliche Geldpolitik erfordert integrierte Finanzmärkte, und dazu gehört zweifelsohne eine Bankenaufsicht auf europäischer Ebene.Durch die europäische Bankenaufsicht können Banken im gesamten Euro-Raum nach denselben hohen Standards überwacht werden. Außerdem lassen sich grenzüberschreitende Probleme durch eine gemeinsame Aufsicht besser handhaben als durch eine rein nationale Aufsicht. Gleichzeitig vergrößert eine Aufsicht auf europäischer Ebene die Distanz zwischen den Aufsehern und den beaufsichtigten Banken. Dadurch verringert sich die Gefahr, dass die Aufseher ihre Banken aus nationalen Interessen heraus mit Samthandschuhen anfassen.Zu einer echten Bankenunion gehört allerdings mehr als nur eine effektive europäische Bankenaufsicht. Die zweite Säule der Bankenunion ist ein europäischer Abwicklungsmechanismus für  Banken. Einen solchen Mechanismus wird es im Euro-Raum ab 2016 geben. Wenn der Ernstfall eintritt und eine Bank nicht mehr überlebensfähig ist, müssen zunächst Eigentümer und Gläubiger die Verluste tragen. Die Steuerzahler stehen in dieser Haftungskette erst ganz am Ende. Dadurch wird der europäische Abwicklungsmechanismus auch dazu beitragen, die enge Verbindung zwischen Banken und öffentlichen Finanzen aufzubrechen, die während der Krise ein zentrales Problem darstellte.Eines sollte jedoch klar sein: Wir können nicht all unsere Probleme wegregulieren. Die Banken selbst müssen sich den Herausforderungen der Zukunft stellen. Eine dieser Herausforderungen ist die Ertragskraft. Angesichts der Kosten einer strengeren Regulierung und des derzeit niedrigen Zinsniveaus fällt es vielen Banken im Euro-Raum schwer, rentabel zu bleiben – vor allem deutsche Banken sind hier betroffen. Daher ist es für die Banken von wesentlicher Bedeutung, ihre Schwächen zu erkennen und rechtzeitig etwas dagegen zu tun.Bei den deutschen Banken könnte dies durch die Steigerung der Provisionserträge sowie die Suche nach kostensenkenden Maßnahmen erfolgen. In Deutschland gibt es traditionell ein weit verzweigtes Filialnetz. Hier könnten durch Straffungen Kosten eingespart werden. Fusionen wären für einige Kreditinstitute ebenfalls sinnvoll. Dabei sollte der Fokus jeweils auf der Tragfähigkeit der einzelnen Geschäftsmodelle liegen.Die Bankenunion stellt zweifellos einen großen Fortschritt bei der Gestaltung eines besseren Rahmens für die Währungsunion dar. Wir sollten unseren Blick aber über den Bankensektor hinaus richten. Eine tiefere Integration der Kapitalmärkte würde gleichfalls dazu beitragen, die Chancen und Risiken zu verteilen.Fest steht, dass wir bereits einen weiten Weg zurückgelegt haben in Richtung integrierter Kapitalmärkte in Europa. Den Statistiken der Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich zufolge beliefen sich die Forderungen europäischer Banken innerhalb Europas Ende der 1990er-Jahre auf 36 Prozent der Wirtschaftsleistung. Bis 2008 war der Anteil auf 77 Prozent gestiegen. Während der Krise ging er zwar wieder zurück, beträgt aber immer noch rund 48 Prozent der Wirtschaftsleistung.Bei diesem Trend zur Kapitalmarktintegration in Europa gibt es allerdings zwei Einschränkungen: Erstens ist die Finanzierungsstruktur europäischer Firmen nach wie vor im Wesentlichen bankbasiert. Ein Blick auf die Bilanzen deutscher Unternehmen zeigt beispielsweise, dass Bankkredite nach wie vor rund 15 Prozent der Passiva ausmachen. Das ist sicherlich weniger als der Ende der 1990er-Jahre verzeichnete Anteil von 22 Prozent, im Vergleich zu den Vereinigten Staaten oder dem Vereinigten Königreich gibt es hier aber noch Raum für eine stärke Finanzierung über die Kapitalmärkte.Zweitens haben zwar die grenzüberschreitenden Forderungen zugenommen, aber die Kapitalmarktintegration ist noch unvollendet. So hat sich die Integration im Bankensektor auf den Interbankenmarkt konzentriert, während die Kreditmärkte für Unternehmen weiterhin überwiegend national ausgerichtet sind. Die Integration der Kapitalmärkte mag in Europa zugenommen haben, doch an der weiterhin überwiegend nationalen Besitzstruktur vieler Unternehmen hat sich nichts geändert.Der recht niedrige Integrationsgrad europäischer Kapitalmärkte stellt ein Hindernis für die Risikoverteilung dar. In den USA beispielsweise ist das Beteiligungskapital viel breiter über das ganze Land hinweg gestreut. Wird eine Branche oder bestimmte Region von einem negativen Schock getroffen, so verteilen sich die Verluste weit über diese Region hinaus. In Europa ist das nicht der Fall, da Beteiligungskapital viel stärker national konzentriert ist.Empirische Studien zu den Vereinigten Staaten zeigen, dass die integrierten Kapitalmärkte rund 40 Prozent der konjunkturellen Schwankungen zwischen den US-amerikanischen Bundesstaaten abfedern. Ungefähr 25 Prozent der Schocks werden über Kreditmärkte und knapp 20 Prozent über fiskalpolitische Mechanismen geglättet. Studien zu Kanada und Schweden liefern ähnliche Ergebnisse.Vor diesem Hintergrund gibt es in Europa zwei generelle Handlungsoptionen. Zum einen könnte es sich günstig auswirken, wenn Unternehmen sich stärker über die Kapitalmärkte finanzieren würden. Dies würde natürlich eine gewisse Abkehr vom traditionellen bankbasierten System erfordern. Hierbei könnte es sich als sinnvoll erweisen, unter anderem die Steuersysteme näher in Augenschein zu nehmen. Derzeit wird die Fremdkapitalfinanzierung gegenüber der Eigenkapitalfinanzierung noch immer steuerlich begünstigt. Die Beseitigung dieser Verzerrung würde Unternehmen dazu ermutigen, ihre Eigenkapitalbasis zu stärken und sich bei der Suche nach Finanzierungsmitteln stärker in Richtung der Kapitalmärkte zu orientieren.Die zweite Handlungsoption bestünde darin, die Integration der Kapitalmärkte zu vertiefen, was in letzter Konsequenz auf eine Kapitalmarktunion hinauslaufen würde. Dabei ist dieses Konzept sicherlich nicht so klar definiert wie das einer Bankenunion. Die Kapitalmärkte sind komplex und die Finanzierung kann viele Formen annehmen: Unternehmensanleihen, privates und börsennotiertes Beteiligungskapital, Wagniskapital oder Peer-to-Peer-Kredite, um nur einige Beispiele zu nennen. Und eine Integration betrifft nicht nur Finanzprodukte, sondern auch integrale Bestandteile der jeweiligen Märkte wie Börsen und zentrale Gegenparteien. Daher würde jeder Versuch, eine Kapitalmarktunion zu schaffen, viele unterschiedliche Maßnahmen in vielen verschiedenen Bereichen erfordern.Gleichwohl hat die Idee einer Kapitalmarktunion in letzter Zeit gewissen Zuspruch erfahren, so unter anderem vom Präsidenten der Europäischen Kommission, Jean-Claude Juncker, und von Yves Mersch, Mitglied des Direktoriums der EZB. Für mich wäre es ein logischer Schritt, wenn die Bankenunion durch eine Kapitalmarktunion ergänzt würde. Dies würde die Fragmentierung der europäischen Finanzmärkte verringern und gleichzeitig deren Effizienz und Stabilität verbessern. Damit ist die Kapitalmarktunion sicherlich ein Ziel, das es wert ist, verfolgt zu werden.Meine Damen und Herren, George Washington soll vor mehr als zwei Jahrhunderten in einem Brief an einen Freund die Entstehung der Vereinigten Staaten von Europa prophezeit haben. Das war zweifellos eine gewagte Prognose, die seit den Tagen Washingtons auch von anderen formuliert wurde, darunter auch Winston Churchill.Hinter dieser Vision der Vereinigten Staaten von Europa verbirgt sich ein sehr breiter Ansatz, der auf eine umfassende politische Integration abzielt. In meinem Vortrag habe ich einen etwas bescheideneren Ansatz gewählt und von einem ökonomischen Standpunkt aus argumentiert. Ich habe drei Bereiche hervorgehoben, in denen eine tiefere Integration dazu beitragen könnte, die Stabilität der Währungsunion zu verbessern.Der erste Bereich sind die öffentlichen Finanzen, wenngleich eine Fiskalunion derzeit eine recht unrealistische Vorstellung ist. Der zweite Bereich ist das Bankensystem. Und hier haben wir einen großen Integrationsschritt unternommen: Am 4. November haben wir die erste Säule der Bankenunion errichtet. Der dritte Bereich sind die Kapitalmärkte. Nach vorne geblickt ist die Kapitalmarktunion ein weiteres Projekt, das zu einer stabileren Währungsunion beitragen würde.Integration ist der richtige Weg nach vorne, sofern sie ausgewogen erfolgt. Nicht alle Vorschläge für eine tiefere Integration, die derzeit im Raum stehen, erfüllen dieses Kriterium. Nehmen Sie das Beispiel Eurobonds: Unter dem Strich kämen solche Euro-Staatsanleihen einer gemeinschaftlichen Garantie für die Schulden der Einzelstaaten gleich. Ein solcher Schritt würde das Ungleichgewicht bei der Integration vergrößern, von dem ich im Zusammenhang mit der Fiskalunion gesprochen habe. Was wir folglich benötigen, sind ausbalancierte Integrationsschritte, so wie ich sie in meinem Vortrag beschrieben habe.Fraglos sind das alles große Schritte, die es aus meiner Sicht aber wert sind, unternommen zu werden. Von einer stabilen Währungsunion werden letztendlich alle Mitgliedstaaten einschließlich Deutschlands profitieren. Davon bin ich zutiefst überzeugt.",2014-11-12,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-11-12,"Hamburg","Germany","Anglo-German Club","Von der Währungsunion zur Bankenunion - Finanzintegration in Europa",1931,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DE"
"2014-11-17 - BuBa - Joachim Nagel.txt","I thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity to speak at today´s European-Chinese Banking Day.The 17th of November is a significant date in global trade. One of the world's most important waterways, the Suez Canal, was opened 145 years ago today. At the time it was just 22 metres wide and 8 metres deep, but it shortened shipping routes significantly. European vessels on their way to Asia have been able to bypass the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa ever since. 51 years ago today, another important transport route was inaugurated: the Europe Bridge in the Alps. It is the centrepiece of the Austrian Brenner Autobahn, which is now one of the most important north-south routes in Europe.But today, on 17 November 2014, the focus isn't primarily on the movement of people or goods, but on payment transactions.Today we want to celebrate the fact that it is now possible to settle transactions in Chinese renminbi via a local clearing bank here in Frankfurt. From now on, it will no longer be necessary to make use of other trading centres like Hong Kong or other trading hubs for this purpose. I shall talk in more detail about the Frankfurt clearing bank in a moment.However, I first want to point out where the renminbi currently stands in its process of internationalisation, and what conditions were necessary for the transformation from a trade currency to an investment currency, and what needs to be fulfilled becoming an international reserve currency.The German writer and critic Kurt Tucholsky noted all the way back in the 1930s that the world economy is interwoven. This is true of today's globalised world more than ever before.Of course, at the time Tucholsky could not have anticipated the rapid pace of development that the People's Republic of China would undergo to become the second largest economy in the world today. As the world's largest exporter, China's foreign trade relations with other countries are highly integrated. This is certainly true of China's economic ties with Germany, which ranks in sixth place in the list of China's ten most important trading partners.Within Europe, Germany is China's most important trading partner. 12 percent of all Chinese imports come from Europe, with 43 percent of these coming from Germany. Put differently, China's trading volume with Germany is the same size as its trading volume with France, the UK and Italy combined. And this is by no means the end of the story. The high level of economic growth expected in China in the coming years represents an opportunity for its trading partners.As a result of its more extensive trading links, China's strong growth and increasing openness also have an impact on Germany, Europe and the rest of the world. Economists know that for every flow of goods there is a corresponding flow of capital. In other words, money flows into an exporting country in exchange for the goods it sells abroad.And this is where the internationalisation of the renminbi comes into play.The Chinese currency is increasingly being used as a trade currency, which a brief glance at the payment statistics will confirm. The dollar has traditionally been the main invoicing currency, though the renminbi now already accounts for about 15 percent of such payments.There are also signs that the renminbi's significance as a trade currency will continue to grow. According to SWIFT data, the value of all renminbi payments around the world has nearly trebled in the last two years. And, in the same period, the number of financial institutions that use renminbi for payments with China and Hong Kong has risen by 35 percent.The majority of renminbi transactions are currently cleared in Hong Kong, but other financial centres are gaining ground. The clearing bank in Frankfurt that I mentioned at the start of my speech is likely to support this trend if not more. German payment transactions in renminbi are growing strongly, up 273 percent in the first nine months of this year alone. Nearly one-quarter of all German enterprises now use renminbi in their business dealings with China.For German enterprises, paying in renminbi is certainly an attractive option.Chinese business partners often provide considerable price advantages to those paying in renminbi. According to a survey by Deutsche Bank, it is possible to negotiate average price reductions of just under 5 percent.Many Chinese enterprises prefer to invoice in renminbi in any case, as it is difficult for them to exchange foreign currencies for renminbi. German entrepreneurs that wish to bolster their market position in China now have a way of entering into business dealings with such Chinese enterprises easier.Despite these advantages, many enterprises still hesitate to use the renminbi. The reasons given are the renminbi's sticky convertibility and restrictions on the movement of capital. Furthermore, until recently it was not possible to directly trade euros and renminbi. Additionally, many SMEs shied away from using offshore markets like Hong Kong, since they want to avoid operating in a different time zone and business language. These caveats are now cleared away by the ongoing liberalisation.Since the end of September, it has also been possible to trade euros and renminbi directly on the Chinese interbank foreign exchange market at an exchange rate fixed by CFETS (China Foreign Exchange Trade System) in Shanghai. The euro has thus become the tenth currency to be exchangeable directly for renminbi.In addition, the Chinese government is currently strengthening the renminbi offshore markets, giving importers outside China a means of paying in renminbi. This year, the Chinese authorities gave the go-ahead for the first clearing banks outside Asia: Germany had the honour of underwriting the first Memorandum of Understanding on Renminbi Clearing in Europe. Subsequently London, Paris, and Luxembourg followed.In future, German enterprises will also be able to settle payments in Chinese currency without having to reroute them via other financial centres. This will reduce transaction costs and make transactions faster.The announcement was enough to trigger a significant increase in renminbi trading in those countries in which clearing banks were approved. The expansion of offshore clearing options is therefore strengthening the significance of the renminbi as a trade currency.Frankfurt as a centre for renminbi tradingThe Chinese government's decision to appoint a clearing bank for renminbi in Frankfurt - namely the Frankfurt branch of the Bank of China - takes account of the very close economic and financial ties between Germany and the People's Republic of China. The expansion of this clearing solution is likely to further reinforce these relations. Furthermore, Frankfurt is one of the most important financial centres in Europe and hosts two central banks.German financial institutions and enterprises as well as government representatives were delighted by the announcement of a renminbi clearing bank in Frankfurt. They are hopeful that the choice will provide a boost for the banking metropolis and, above all, for the real economy.Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, which form the backbone of the German economy, can tap into the Chinese market more easily or for the first time ever using the option of renminbi clearing from Germany. The clearing bank's expertise and experience will make up for uncertainty or lack of knowledge about renminbi payment transactions with China. Additionally, payments can be cleared within the enterprises own time zone and with client managers speaking their native language.However, establishing the clearing bank is only the first step. Just as the once very narrow Suez Canal was gradually widened to accommodate enormous container ships - and is now due to be expanded further by building a new canal alongside the existing waterway - the aim here is to expand the clearing bank to form a clearing house in future, too.This would offer all banks in Germany the opportunity not only to use clearing services but also to shape the design and further development of the clearing house as its co-owners. As a result, the Frankfurt financial centre would be able to position itself as a genuine RMB clearing hub in the European time zone.The renminbi is therefore gaining traction as a trade currency and has in my opinion already reached the level of an investment currency. Expanding use of the renminbi as a global investment currency would mark a further step towards internationalisation.The more liquid, renminbi-denominated financial assets are issued, the further the volumes invested in renminbi will increase.Important is that the Chinese financial and capital markets are sufficiently deep and receptive to foreign capital.Due to restrictions on capital movements, the currency is still traded on two different markets: onshore and offshore.Renminbi-denominated bonds known as “dim sum bonds”, which are issued by both Chinese and non-Chinese issuers, are traded on the offshore renminbi markets - that is to say, outside mainland China. The number of dim sum bonds issued has skyrocketed ever since they were launched in 2007, with a new record level of 451 billion yuan also being achieved in the first nine months of 2014 compared with 376 billion yuan for the whole of 2013.Dim sum bonds have also been issued in Frankfurt already. Market participants call them “Goethe Bonds”. The trend was started by KfW in April 2014 followed by the Agricultural Bank of China and the China Construction Bank. And I am sure other issues will follow.In contrast to the comparatively open offshore markets, investors must apply for quotas before they are granted access to the onshore market.By far the largest onshore market is the interbank bond market, which is currently open to institutional investors only. In July 2014, Germany received a Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota of 80 billion yuan. Beside the Renminbi Clearing Bank, this was another key milestone for the renminbi hub in Frankfurt. The RQFII quotas enable financial institutions such as asset manager to invest a maximum of just over €10 billion in mainland China. The transactions can be settled via the clearing bank in Frankfurt.However, surveys among market participants indicate that investors still have some reservations about investing in renminbi. The potential barriers they cite are: operational difficulties, lack of investment products, quota restrictions on investment, concerns about prospects of the currency as a long-term value store and lack of a legal framework.As I have already mentioned, it is likely that operational issues will soon become less important.Further reform efforts to make the financial markets more open and receptive are a crucial step towards a flexible and internationally used currency.To this end, Zhou Xiaochan, the Governor of the People's Bank of China, assured participants at an IMF committee meeting that major structural reforms in the financial markets would be pushed forward. He explained that the market-based interest rate reform would continue, that the renminbi exchange rate reform would be improved and that the pace of capital account convertibility would be steadily promoted.With regard to long-term value and potential legal risks, the same applies to Chinese monetary, fiscal and economic policy as to all other currency areas: sound decisions must be made and implemented promptly in order to create and maintain lasting confidence.Ladies and gentlemen, many economists, including myself, believe that it is only a matter of time before the renminbi becomes an international reserve currency. This would be the next step after becoming an investment currency: not only private investors would hold renminbi-denominated assets, but so would central banks.But how does an investment currency become an international reserve currency?The IMF has defined a number of criteria that must be met for this to happen.Allow me to outline the three most important criteria. The currency must be liquid. International reserve currencies are used for interventions in the foreign exchange market, which means that it must be possible to sell or buy the assets quickly and at minimal cost. This is linked to the second condition. The currency must be freely convertible. This means it must be possible to convert it into different currencies in unlimited amounts and at any time. The assets must basically be safe. They must therefore meet the highest standards of credit quality.The restrictive capital flow regulations and an exchange rate that is steered by central bank intervention mean that the renminbi does not currently meet the IMF's criteria for an international reserve currency. However, over 20 central banks, including a number of European central banks, hold renminbi in their portfolio.In my opinion, the renminbi has the potential to become a global reserve currency, but still has some way to go.I see this potential because thanks to China's economic strength, the renminbi has already become established as a trade currency and its importance will probably continue to increase. The renminbi managed its way to an investment currency very smart. And the leap from an investment currency for investors to an investment currency for central banks - in other words, to an international reserve currency - is not so very large.But I believe the challenge lies in making the transition from a renminbi that is convertible to a limited extent to a renminbi that is freely convertible.The Chinese government is taking a gradual approach in this regard. This means that it will also decide when the renminbi meets the basic condition for use as a global reserve currency.Ladies and gentlemen, the international role of a currency can be evaluated by looking at how it is used in payment transactions, or in other words: as a trade currency, in the asset markets, which is to say as an investment currency, and potentially even as a reserve currency.The renminbi has succeeded in becoming a trade currency and its use has increased rapidly over the last few years.Nowadays we are witnessing the rise as an investment currency, and ultimately the renminbi has the potential to become an international reserve currency. However, this will not be possible without liberalising capital flows and making the currency fully convertible.The renminbi's greater international role will benefit both the Chinese economy and its trading partners. This should provide an incentive to explore this path further.Together with the Federal Ministry of Finance and the state of Hesse, the Bundesbank has laid the foundations for a smoothly functioning renminbi hub in Frankfurt. The infrastructure has been established, and the ball is now in the court of the financial industry, which must make active use of these excellent conditions by creating suitable products and bringing trading volumes to the platform.In line with the saying that a speaker should exhaust the topic and not the audience, I would now like to draw to a close and thank you for your attention.",2014-11-17,"BuBa","Joachim Nagel",2014-11-17,"Frankfurt","Germany","European-Chinese Banking Day","Internationalisation of the renminbi: challenges and opportunities",2455,20.2,5.1,40.9,12.5,"EN"
"2014-11-18 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for the invitation and the opportunity to speak again at the Euro Finance Week. It is a pleasure to be here today. Let us briefly discuss physics before we turn to a topic that is more related to the Euro Finance Week.The British astronomer Martin Rees once said: We can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang, but we still don't know what banged and why it banged. That's a challenge for 21st century science.Well, the euro area had its own Big Bang two weeks ago, and in this case we know pretty well what banged - and why. On 4 November, the ECB became the direct supervisor for the 120 largest banks in the euro area which, in terms of assets, represent more than 80 percent of the euro area's banking system. Thus, with a big bang, the ECB became one of the largest banking supervisors in the world.Taking banking supervision from the national to the European level has been the biggest step of financial integration in Europe since the introduction of the euro in 1999. This big bang created a new universe for the banks and the financial markets.But what exactly can we expect from the new European banking supervision? And probably even more importantly: what is it that we cannot expect from it? In the following I would like to discuss both questions.Taking banking supervision from the national level to the European level addresses three problems that became apparent during the recent crisis.First, European banking supervision will allow banks in the entire euro area to be supervised according to the same high standards. These standards will emerge from sharing experience across borders and taking the best parts from every national approach towards banking supervision. Germany, for instance, could benefit from a more quantitative-oriented approach towards banking supervision which other countries already follow.Second, European banking supervision will make it possible to effectively identify and manage cross-border problems. This is essential because today, large banks are usually active in more than one country. The failure of the Franco-Belgian bank Dexia in 2011 is a classic example in which banking supervision with a cross-border focus could have improved crisis management. Another example is the case of German Hypo Real Estate, which failed in 2009.Third, taking banking supervision from the national to the European level will add a degree of separation between supervisors and the banks they supervise. This will prevent supervisors from treating their banks with kid-gloves out of national interest. Nevertheless, we can expect European banking supervision to draw upon the experience and resources of national supervisors. Supervision itself will take place in so-called joint supervisory teams. These teams are headed by ECB staff but are composed of national supervisors.To sum up: there is a lot we can expect from European banking supervision, and now it has to deliver. In this regard, we should remember one thing: European banking supervision is an immensely complex operation that has been put together in a very short time. Thus, it would probably be unrealistic to expect everything to run smoothly from day one. It will certainly take some time before every detail is sorted out deep down in the engine room of actual banking supervision. Nevertheless, I am confident that we will get there and that our expectations will be fulfilled.But we should not let unrealistic expectations become the roots of complacency and, consequently, disappointment. European banking supervision is not the holy grail of financial stability. It certainly contributes to making banks more stable, but it is no panacea. Thus, we have to supplement it with other measures. Let me elaborate on one point in that regard.Banking supervision cannot prevent individual banks from failing - not at the national level and not at the European level. Is this a problem? Not at all: the possibility of failure is an essential element of a market economy.Nevertheless, banks are special in that respect. Just remember the 15th of September 2008, when the failure of a single investment bank pushed the financial system to the brink of collapse. The lesson is that the failure of  very large or interconnected banks can lead to a systemic crisis. Thus, these banks are perceived as being too big to fail: when push comes to shove, the government might be compelled to step in to prevent disaster.Consequently, too big to fail banks operate with an implicit and cost-free insurance. Apart from the costs this insurance imposes on taxpayers, it most definitely sets the wrong incentives for the risk-conscious behaviour of banks. Thus, solving the too big to fail problem is paramount for making the financial system more stable and saving taxpayers' money.Can European banking supervision solve that problem? Well, it can certainly contribute by putting too big to fail banks under close observation. And yet it has to be supplemented with other measures. And here, we recently made some progress - at the global level and at the European level.At the global level, the G20 Heads of Governments and States have just this Sunday decided on international criteria that global systemically important banks will have to fulfil in future regarding their capital structure. In particular, these banks will need a minimum amount of Total Loss Absorbing Capacity - in short TLAC. This approach combines the existing minimum capital requirements with new requirements to ensure that large banks have sufficient capacity to absorb losses, both before and during resolution.TLAC therefore, in my view, represents a watershed in ending too big to fail. It will allow for the orderly resolution of those banks without disrupting the financial system and while protecting taxpayers from having to foot the bill. For the TLAC-concept, I wish to signal my strong support.To achieve these worthy goals, I suggest agreeing upon a figure at the upper end of the range of 16 percent - 20 percent proposed by the FSB. However, reaching an agreement on TLAC is not the finish line of the regulatory agenda. The next months need to be used for in-depth public consultation as well as an impact study of the new rules. I hope that this study will lend support to a figure at the upper end of the proposed range. Finally, after both the impact study and the public consultation, implementation is the next step, and this should not be underestimated.Another major step towards solving the too big to fail problem has been taken with regard to cross-border resolution. In October, 18 global banks and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreed to implement new rules on derivatives trading. Whenever a large bank fails, these rules will allow authorities to temporarily suspend the right of other banks to terminate derivatives contracts. This will buy precious time to organise an orderly resolution of the failed bank. However, it is paramount that we not only have the necessary procedures in place to wind down a failed bank, but the political will to go through with it. This political will exists in Germany and is a universal pre-condition for ending too big to fail.We have also made progress at the European level. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive spells out clear rules on who has to bear the costs when a bank fails. In a nutshell: bail-out is out and bail-in is in. In future, shareholders and creditors will be first in line when it comes to bearing losses; taxpayers will be last in line. This directive will be implemented in Germany in early 2015; the latest possible date for implementation in other countries is 2016.Also from 2016 onwards, European banking supervision will be supplemented with a European resolution mechanism for banks. From then on, the banking union will rest on two pillars and provide a stable framework for European financial markets.What does all that mean for the banks? In essence, regulators and supervisors are working towards strengthening the principles of a market economy. Naturally, this puts more weight on the shoulders of market participants, that is, the banks. In future, there will be no public lifeguard standing by to bail banks out when things go wrong. Failure has become a real possibility and banks have to acknowledge that.They should have an interest in safeguarding their stability and strengthening their profitability. Regarding the stability of banks, the comprehensive assessment provided a deep insight into the state of the European system. So let us take a closer look at the German banks that were subjected to that assessment.All in all, German banks did rather well. Of the 25 German banks that were examined, there was only one technical failure, since the bank in question has already remedied its capital shortfall. Over all, it could be concluded that German banks are stable enough from a capital point of view to cope with severe economic stress.But again, no bank should give in to complacency. And neither should supervisors. We should, for instance, be aware that the comprehensive assessment focused on risk-weighted capital ratios. Markets and supervisors, however, also cast an eye on unweighted capital ratios. And with regard to these leverage ratios, German banks are below average compared to other euro-area countries. Thus, there is ample room to catch-up and improve stability even further.Nevertheless, while stability is necessary for a bank, it is not sufficient. Banks have to be profitable as well. And in this regard, too, German banks need to catch up. Their return on assets and their return on equity are also relatively low compared to other euro-area countries. A recent study even comes to the conclusion that only 6 percent of German banks earned their cost of capital last year.What can explain these weak earnings? Well, the main culprit in Germany seems to be a business model that is relatively dependent on interest income. Such a business model poses a major challenge in the current environment of low interest rates. Consequently, in the first six months of this year, the operative results of the large German banks were about 8 percent below their 2013 levels - a result which was largely driven by a contracting interest margin. Nonetheless, banks are also faced with a structural problem in this context: the interest margin has been declining constantly since the mid-1980s.The banks should therefore reconsider their business models and gear them towards sustainable profitability. To be sure, the need to adapt business models is not only relevant for German banks. However, in its recent Financial Stability Report, the IMF finds that German banks are again below average in terms of reforming their business models. Again, there is room to catch up with international peers.An obvious strategy for the German banks would be to diversify their sources of income away from interest income. Looking at the cost-side, German banks fare rather well compared to other countries. That is the good news. But there are still options to reduce costs. In this regard, mergers may well be a potential strategy. The German banking market still offers scope for further consolidation - the focus here should, of course, always remain on arriving at a sustainable business model.As a side note: in future, European banking supervision will also keep a close watch on the business models of banks. However, we should not expect supervisors to be the better bankers. At the end of the day, management decisions have to be taken by those who bear the risks and reap the rewards. What the supervisors could do is impose additional capital or liquidity requirements whenever they have doubts about the sustainability of a bank's business model.Ladies and gentlemenThere is no doubt: European banking supervision is an important step forward in ensuring financial stability in the euro area. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, unrealistic expectations are the roots of complacency and, consequently, of disappointment.European banking supervision is just the first pillar of the envisaged banking union. It has to be supplemented with the European resolution mechanism for banks. This second pillar of the banking union will be erected in 2016. Eventually, the banking union will provide a stable framework for the banking system and strengthen market forces.This, in turn, puts more responsibility into the hands of banks. It is up to each individual bank to ensure its own stability and profitability. This requires the banks to rethink their business models and to rethink their culture. Regulatory measures like TLAC that will abolish implicit guarantees for banks will also necessitate changes in banks' behaviour for the better.  The original role of banks is to service the real economy. Putting this idea back into the heads of bankers would contribute greatly to making the financial system more stable. We have to do away with a culture in which everything is allowed that is not explicitly forbidden. We need a culture which encourages bankers to look beyond the horizon of short-term returns.If banks succeed in creating such a culture, they will eventually regain the trust of the people that got lost in the crisis. Regulation and supervision can play a supporting role, but the burden ultimately lies with the banks.",2014-11-18,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-11-18,"Frankfurt","Germany","Euro Finance Week","Big bang banking union - what can we expect?",2190,16.7,4.9,48.3,10.6,"EN"
"2014-11-19 - BuBa - Carl-Ludwig Thiele.txt","vielen Dank für Ihre einleitenden Worte. Bei dieser Gelegenheit möchte ich Ihnen zu Ihrem neuen Amt als Vorsitzender der Euro Banking Association gratulieren und Ihnen ein gutes Gelingen bei der Amtsführung wünschen. Sie werden es gut gebrauchen können. Denn im Zahlungsverkehr stehen in der nächsten Zeit einige Herausforderungen an, die uns alle betreffen.Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, sehr geehrter Herr Professor Bott,lassen Sie mich mit einem einerseits-andererseits beginnen. Einerseits haben wir Großes geleistet. Wir haben für die Überweisung und die Lastschrift gemeinsame europäische Verfahren eingeführt. Alleine in Deutschland werden im täglichen Durchschnitt nun gut 50 Millionen Transaktionen als SEPA-Zahlungen abgewickelt. Andererseits ist es damit nicht getan. Die vielen Presseartikel über Zahlungsverkehrsthemen lassen vermuten, dass im Zahlungsverkehr nicht wieder die Ruhe einkehren wird, die Jahrzehnte vorher in diesem Sektor geherrscht hat. Dies bietet Chancen, aber auch Risiken für alle Beteiligten. In jedem Fall sorgt es aber dafür, dass der Zahlungsverkehr zunehmend das Image der Grauen Maus ablegt und zu einem sehr interessanten und äußerst spannenden Spielfeld wird.Die noch verbleibenden Herausforderungen, die sich nach der Einführung von SEPA für Überweisung und Lastschrift ergeben, möchte ich an den Anfang meiner Rede stellen. Anschließend möchte ich auf den Kartenmarkt in Europa eingehen, der sich zurzeit vor allem im Hinblick auf die kommende EU-Verordnung zu Interbankenentgelten im Umbruch befindet. Am Ende steht ein Ausblick auf die Marktöffnung im Zahlungsverkehr, die sich aufgrund von technischen Entwicklungen, neuen Anbietern und regulatorischen Eingriffen abzeichnet.Obwohl Deutschland lange die rote Laterne bei der Umstellung von SEPA in Europa zu tragen schien, ist es auch durch eine entsprechende Kommunikation und entsprechende Hilfestellung durch den SEPA-Rat gelungen, auf der Zielgeraden noch einmal richtig Gas zu geben.Die Umstellung auf SEPA ist reibungslos verlaufen. Eine Pressemitteilung mit dieser Überschrift hätten wir planmäßig gern im Februar 2014 herausgegeben, konnten sie aber letztlich erst im August 2014 veröffentlichen. Die Debatte, ob die Verschiebung des Endtermins erforderlich war, ist zwischenzeitlich obsolet geworden. Doch sollte der Gesetzgeber in jedem Falle darauf achten, dass solche Verschiebungen nicht zum Regelfall werden. Nichtsdestotrotz sind die SEPA-Verfahren nun eingeführt. Doch das Leben mit den SEPA-Verfahren im Euroraum ist noch nicht ganz frei von Reibungen.So haben die Menschen in Deutschland die IBAN noch immer nicht so richtig ins Herz geschlossen, was man bei einer 22-stelligen Nummer sicherlich auch nicht erwarten kann. Aber die Aufregung hat sich gelegt. An dieser Stelle möchte ich noch einmal an die Kreditwirtschaft, aber auch an die Wirtschaft allgemein appellieren, die IBAN auf Rechnungen und auf Briefbögen in Viererblöcken anzugeben. Das macht die manuelle Übertragung wesentlich einfacher. Der Mut zur Lücke kann sich hier sprichwörtlich bezahlt machen. Vielleicht hat sich die Aufregung um die IBAN auch gelegt, weil viele Konsumenten sie noch gar nicht benutzen, sondern weiter mit Kontonummer und Bankleitzahl arbeiten. Das ist für Verbraucher in Deutschland bis Februar 2016 möglich. Ich hoffe allerdings, dass nicht erst das Auslaufen dieser Regelung dazu führen wird, dass sich Verbraucher dann erstmals mit der IBAN beschäftigen werden.Mit einer gewissen Sorge sehe ich den Februar 2016 näher heranrücken. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt ist die Nutzung von SEPA für alle Teilnehmer am Zahlungsverkehr verbindlich umzusetzen. Ich habe eine gewisse Sorge, ob bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt jeder Kunde erreicht werden kann, damit jeder diese Verpflichtung erfüllt. Hier begrüße ich es, dass sich die Deutsche Bundesbank mit der Kreditwirtschaft in einem intensiven Dialog befindet.Bis Februar 2016 soll auch der grenzüberschreitende Zahlungsverkehr im Euroraum ohne Angabe des BICs funktionieren. Der Gesetzgeber möchte damit die Nutzung von Zahlungsdiensten vereinfachen. In Deutschland ist die Bankleitzahl Bestandteil der IBAN, das heißt sie enthält bereits die Adresse des Zahlungsdienstleisters. Für die Kreditwirtschaft ist die Umsetzung dieser Regelung mit einigem Aufwand verbunden. Denn der grenzüberschreitende Zahlungsverkehr beruht weltweit auf dem BIC als Routingkriterium, und auch alle Clearingsysteme sind auf den BIC ausgelegt. Aus diesem Grund kann sich die Kreditwirtschaft für die SEPA-Zahlungen nicht einfach vom BICverabschieden, sondern sie benötigt eine Software, die die nationale Bankadresse mit der internationalen Bankadresse matcht. Dies funktioniert nur, wenn es eine Datenbank gibt, die diese Informationen bereitstellt. In Deutschland führt die Bundesbank seit Jahren im Auftrag der Deutschen Kreditwirtschaft eine solche Datenbank. Doch in anderen europäischen Ländern ist dies vielfach weniger zentral organisiert. Das Eurosystem setzt hier auf den Markt. Allerdings würden wir es begrüßen, wenn die Kreditwirtschaft hier Vorsorge treffen würde: Die Institute, die die SEPA-Adherence Agreements gezeichnet haben, sollten Änderungen ihrer Adressen (BIC und der jeweilige IBAN-Bestandteil) verpflichtend an zentralen nationalen Stellen ablegen und aktualisieren. Dies würde die Datenqualität der bis Februar 2016 zu entwickelnden Software-Lösungen deutlich verbessern.Ein gemeinsamer Binnenmarkt im Zahlungsverkehr in Europa ist das politische Ziel der Europäischen Union, dem wir mit der Einführung der SEPA-Überweisung und der SEPA-Lastschrift ein gutes Stück näher gekommen sind. Dennoch funktioniert der Euroraum an manchen Stellen noch nicht so, wie man es von einem gemeinsamen harmonisierten Markt erwartet. Dies zeigt sich beispielsweise, wenn es um die Erfüllung der in der SEPA-Verordnung festgelegten Vorschrift geht, dass Zahlungsempfänger bei Lastschriften Bankverbindungen aus allen Ländern des Euroraums akzeptieren müssen. Die SEPA-Devise Ein Konto für ganz Europa kann nicht Realität werden, wenn deutsche Internethändler für den Lastschrifteinzug deutsche IBAN-Nummern verlangen. Über diese Art von IBAN-Diskriminierung beklagen sich Konsumenten immer häufiger: bei der BaFin, bei den Verbraucherschutzverbänden, bei der EU-Kommission und bei uns.Wenn man die Unternehmen darauf hinweist, dass es sich hier um einen Gesetzesverstoß handelt, verweisen sie etwa auf die unterschiedliche Geschwindigkeit, mit der Lastschriften abgewickelt werden. Während in Deutschland mit dem COR1-Verfahren eine eintägige Vorlauffrist ausreicht, sind es in den anderen Ländern noch fünf Tage. Aber Abhilfe ist in Sicht: Eine europaweite Nutzung des COR1-Verfahrens ist ab November 2016 möglich. Würde man die betroffenen Unternehmen verpflichten, in der Übergangszeit bis 2016 bei Lastschriften völlig diskriminierungsfrei zu arbeiten, würden sie nach eigenen Angaben im Zweifel auf das Instrument der Lastschrift verzichten. Dies kann aber nicht im Interesse aller Beteiligter sein.   Meine Damen und Herren, nun haben wir die SEPA-Überweisung und die SEPA-Lastschrift eingeführt, doch wie ist das eigentlich mit den Kartenzahlungen? In diesem Bereich herrschen viele Missverständnisse vor. Dies ist sicherlich dem Umstand geschuldet, dass es sich hier um einen historisch gewachsenen Geschäftsbereich handelt, in dem über die Arrangements der Beteiligten wenig bekannt ist – vorausgesetzt natürlich, die Verfahren funktionierten. Mittlerweile hat sich die Kartenzahlung zum wichtigsten bargeldlosen Zahlungsmittel nicht nur in den Vereinigten Staaten oder Kanada, sondern auch in einigen europäischen Ländern entwickelt. Hier sind insbesondere Frankreich, Großbritannien, aber auch die skandinavischen Länder zu nennen.Festzustellen ist, dass sich die SEPA-Verordnung von 2012 ausdrücklich nur auf die Überweisung und die Lastschrift bezieht. Die SEPA-Verordnung zeichnet sich durch eine sehr hohe technische Detailtiefe aus. Es musste etwa auf den BIC, die IBANund andere ISO-Standards zurückgegriffen werden, um eine klare Definition der gewünschten gemeinsamen Standards hinzubekommen. Vor dem Hintergrund, dass noch erhebliche Standardisierungsarbeiten zu leisten sind, hatte der europäische Gesetzgeber in diesem Stadium der Marktentwicklung davon abgesehen, via Regulierung eine standardisierte Kartenzahlung für Europa zu definieren und zur Norm zu erklären.  Nichtsdestotrotz sieht der europäische Gesetzgeber die Notwendigkeit, allgemeine Regeln für das Kartengeschäft zu setzen. Doch geht es dabei nicht in erster Linie um die Einheitlichkeit des Binnenmarktes. Hier stehen wettbewerbspolitische Gründe im Vordergrund. Die nun gerade im TRILOG zwischen EU-Kommission, EU-Rat und EU-Parlament diskutierte Verordnung über Interbankenentgelte für kartengebundene Zahlungsvorgänge enthält Obergrenzen für die Interbankenentgelte ebenso wie verschiedene Vorschriften zur Geschäftspraxis von Kartensystemen.Aus Sicht der Wettbewerbsbehörden sind die Interbankenentgelte problematisch, weil sie als Teil der Händlergebühr einfach bis an die Konsumenten durchgereicht würden. Dies führe zu falschen Anreizstrukturen. Denn für die herausgebenden Zahlungsdienstleister seien Kartensysteme umso attraktiver, je höher die Interbankenentgelte ausfallen. Dies geht zunächst zulasten des Handels oder letztlich zulasten aller Käufer.Als Zentralbank halten wir uns aus wettbewerbsrechtlichen Fragen eher heraus, aber das Scheitern der inzwischen schon fast in Vergessenheit geratenen Initiative für ein europäisches Kartensystem (MONNET) hat uns gezeigt, dass stabile Rahmenbedingungen in diesem komplizierten Geschäft entscheidend sind. Und der bis dahin von der EU-Kommission verfolgte einzelwirtschaftliche Ansatz war in dieser Hinsicht eher abträglich. Denn der Aufbau von Infrastrukturen im Zahlungsverkehr macht hohe Investitionen notwendig. Dies lässt sich schlecht mit dem Risiko in Einklang bringen, dass über die Zulässigkeit der Höhe der Interbankenentgelte erst im Nachhinein ein Placet von den Aufsichtsbehörden zu bekommen ist. Vor diesem Hintergrund haben wir als eine Zentralbank im Eurosystem den Vorschlag für eine allgemeingültige Regelung der Interbankenentgelte im Kartengeschäft grundsätzlich begrüßt. Konkret hat die EU-Kommission Obergrenzen für Interbankenentgelte von 0,2 Prozent für Debitkarten und 0,3 Prozent für Kreditkarten vorgesehen. Die Höhe passt zu ihren bisher getroffenen Einzelfallentscheidungen. Sollte es hierbei bleiben, würden für Interbankenentgelte die 0,2 Prozent für Debitkarten und 0,3 Prozent für Kreditkarten zur Benchmark werden.Mit welchen Punkten muss sich der TRILOG noch beschäftigen? Sicherlich ganz entscheidend ist für alle kartenherausgebenden Institute die Frage, ob die vom EU-Parlament vorgeschlagene absolute Obergrenze für Interbankenentgelte bestehen bleibt. Hier werden sieben Cent als Höchstgrenze vorgeschlagen. Im deutschen ec-cash-System lag das Minimum für die Händlerentgelte bisher bei acht Cent. Sieht man sich diese Diskrepanz an, so liegt hier vielleicht ein Missverständnis vor. Bezogen auf den Durchschnittsbetrag von 56,54 Euro je Transaktion mit Debitkarten in Deutschland würde statt der ursprünglich postulierten Deckelung bei 0,2 Prozent nur noch ein Durchschnittswert von 0,12 Prozent zugestanden. Ob dies wirklich so gewollt ist, sollte man im TRILOG noch einmal genau überdenken. Denn für die kartenausgebenden Zahlungsdienstleister sind Interbankenentgelte ein entscheidender wirtschaftlicher Faktor. Wenn sich das Kartengeschäft für sie nur noch dadurch rechnet, dass sie ihren Kunden immense Jahresgebühren für die Karten auferlegen, könnte sich die Verbreitung und Nutzung von Zahlungskarten deutlich reduzieren. Ich gehe davon aus, dass niemand ein Interesse daran hat, dass sich die Kartenzahlung zu einem Nischenprodukt im europäischen Zahlungsverkehr entwickelt.Neben der vorwiegend wettbewerbspolitisch motivierten Regelung zur Höhe der Interbankenentgelte steht aber die Harmonisierung weiter auf der Agenda der europäischen Regulatoren. In der nun im TRILOG diskutierten Verordnung sollen dazu zum Teil Geschäftspraktiken untersagt werden, die etwa ein grenzüberschreitendes Acquiring behindern.Eine echte Harmonisierung kommt aber um die Bits und Bytes nicht herum. Denn es bedarf technischer Standards für die Schnittstellen zwischen Karte und Händlerterminal sowie Händlerterminal und Händlerbank und letztlich auch für das Kartenclearing zwischen Händlerbank und dem Kartenherausgeber, um einen gemeinsamen Markt im Kartengeschäft zu schaffen. Hier bleiben die Marktteilnehmer gefordert. In der konkreten Umsetzung europäischer Standards befindet sich bereits die Umstellung der Abwicklung von girocard-Zahlungen auf das SEPA Card Clearing (SCC). Aus meiner Sicht könnte dies zu einem guten Beispiel für eine erfolgreiche europäische Standardisierung werden. Hier wurde von europäischen Marktteilnehmern ein neuer Standard für das Clearing von Kartentransaktionen auf dem europäischen Kartenmarkt entwickelt. Durch die technische Orientierung an der SEPA-Lastschrift lassen sich erhebliche Synergien in den Banken und bei den Clearinghäusern heben, die bereits SEPA-Lastschriften verarbeiten. Es werden nur die Daten verwendet, die für den Clearingprozess gebraucht werden; alle anderen Karteninformationen werden in einem Container mitgegeben. Durch SCC wird die Abwicklung von Kartentransaktionen für den grenzüberschreitenden Wettbewerb geöffnet und es werden vor allem auch Eintrittsbarrieren für neue Anbieter abgebaut. Die Bundesbank bietet die Abwicklung von girocard-Zahlungen in ihren Systemen ab dem 14. April 2015 an.Bisher kümmert sich die Cards Stakeholder Group um die Standardisierung im Kartengeschäft, und zwar mit einer breit angelegten Repräsentation aller Beteiligter. Allerdings soll diese nun dem neu gegründeten Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) Bericht erstatten, das von der EZB geleitet wird. Die EU-Kommission ist im ERPB als Beobachter vertreten. Ich will nicht unken, meine Damen und Herren, wenn ich sage, dass einige  Marktteilnehmer dies als den kalten Hauch des Regulierers im Nacken wahrnehmen könnten. Allerdings gehen die Überlegungen an dieser Stelle nicht in Richtung einer neuen EU-Verordnung. Vielmehr ist hier die Frage, ob zur Festlegung von technischen Standards nicht europäische Zertifizierungsbehörden wie das European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) oder das European Committee for Standardization (CEN) eingebunden werden könnten oder – wenn es der Markt nicht schafft – sogar müssten. Gravierende Auswirkungen für die Kreditwirtschaft wird auch das zweite große Regulierungsvorhaben der Europäischen Union nach sich ziehen. Es ist die Überarbeitung der Zahlungsdiensterichtlinie, besser bekannt als Payment Services Directive 2 oder kurz PSD2.Ein wesentlicher Baustein ist angesichts der vielfältigen technischen Neuerungen die Gewährleistung der Sicherheit im Zahlungsverkehr. Denn neue Produkte versprechen nur dann Erfolg, wenn sie das Sicherheitsbedürfnis der Nutzer befriedigen können. Das Eurosystem hat hier zusammen mit den Aufsichtsbehörden im sogenannten SecuRe-Pay Forum wichtige Basisarbeit geleistet und zum Beispiel mit den Empfehlungen für Zahlungen im Internet einen wichtigen Standard gesetzt. Wichtigste Neuerung ist, dass bei Zahlungen im Internet künftig immer zwei Faktoren zur Freigabe notwendig sind. Nach derzeitigem Stand der PSD2 muss einer davon immer auch direkt an die Transaktionsdaten geknüpft sein.Eine weitere Neuerung in diesem Bereich ist die Einbeziehung von Zahlungsauslösediensten, die hier geregelt werden soll. Dahinter steht wiederum in erster Linie eine wettbewerbspolitische Motivation: Es geht darum, den kontoführenden Kreditinstituten eine Monopolisierung des Zugangs zu untersagen. Bisher durfte der Kunde eines Kreditinstituts seine Kontozugangsdaten aus Sicherheitsgründen nicht an Dritte weitergeben. Dazu wurde er in den Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen verpflichtet. Inzwischen sind am Markt Angebote von nicht-beaufsichtigten Firmen entstanden, die im Kundenauftrag mit den ihnen anvertrauten Zugangsdaten via Onlinebanking auf das Konto zugreifen, um Zahlungen im eCommerce auszulösen. Damit ist ein Rechtsvakuum entstanden, das auch aus Zentralbanksicht nicht haltbar war. Daher ist die Initiative durchaus willkommen, eine Regelung für das Zusammenspiel von kontoführenden Zahlungsdienstleistern und Zahlungsauslösediensten zu finden.Allerdings hat sich die Integration dieser Empfehlungen in einen Gesetzestext als eine echte Herausforderung erwiesen. Denn auch hier möchte der Gesetzgeber von zu technischen Regelungen in einer Richtlinie absehen, aber das Zepter weiter in der Hand behalten. Dazu wird nun die European Banking Authority herangezogen. Sie soll zum Beispiel Richtlinien aufstellen, welche Voraussetzungen an eine Schnittstelle von kontoführenden Instituten und Zahlungsauslösedienste geknüpft werden sollen. Aus meiner Sicht darf man dabei zwei Aspekte nicht aus den Augen verlieren: Der Markt braucht dringend Klarheit, um Sicherheit für anstehende Investitionen zu haben. Dies ist gerade heute wichtig, da das Zahlen mit dem Smartphone bald aus den Kinderschuhen schlüpft und das Pilotstadium verlassen wird. Und gerade für den eCommerce brauchen wir sichere und effiziente Lösungen – und keineswegs nur die Dienste weniger internationaler Anbieter. Auf dem Markt für Zahlungsdienste haben sich Unternehmen etabliert, die Zahlungsauslösedienste anbieten. Diese Tatsache werden alle Beteiligten akzeptieren müssen. Die Kreditwirtschaft muss daher in den sicheren Zugang zu den Konten investieren. Aber es ist auch klar, dass hierfür ein angemessener wirtschaftlicher Ausgleich gefunden werden muss. Meine Damen und Herren, Sie haben gesehen, dass auch nach der Einführung von SEPA-Überweisung und SEPA-Lastschrift der Zahlungsverkehr weit davon entfernt ist, wieder in den Zustand des grauen Alltags zu fallen. Dafür sorgt vor allem der zunehmende Wettbewerb durch Nichtbanken als Anbieter von Zahlungsdiensten. Dies ist ein Trend, der den Zahlungsverkehr weltweit  nachhaltig verändern wird. Deshalb hat sich auch eine Arbeitsgruppe bei der Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich mit diesem Thema auseinandergesetzt. Den gerade erschienen Bericht Non-Banks in Retail Payments kann ich Ihnen zur Lektüre empfehlen.Besonderes Augenmerk bei den strukturellen Umbrüchen, die uns im Zahlungsverkehr bevorstehen, verdienen die großen Unternehmen aus dem Internet-Universum, die in den Markt drängen. Denn sie haben schon jetzt den direkten Zugang zu treuen Kunden – bei einigen Anbietern geht die Beziehung vielfach weit über eine traditionelle Kundenbeziehung hinaus, zum Beispiel bei Apple Pay in Kalifornien oder Alibaba in China. Bei der Einführung von Zahlungsdiensten könnten sie im Nu eine hohe Abdeckung auf der Zahlerseite erreichen, der sich der Handel kaum verweigern würde. Über europäische Standards müssen diese Anbieter nicht lange nachdenken, denn im Zweifel setzen sie die Standards weltweit selbst. Dabei tritt ein Widerspruch immer deutlicher zutage: die rasante technologische Entwicklung steht vielfach langwierigen und komplizierten politischen Abstimmungsprozessen zu neuen Regelungen in Europa – und vielfach sogar in den nationalen Bankengremien – gegenüber. Damit Europa im Markt für Zahlungsdienste nicht den Anschluss im weltweiten Wettbewerb verliert, zum Beispiel bei Instant Payments, sollten die laufenden Regulierungsvorhaben zügig zu Ende geführt werden, und dem Markt dann wieder Luft zum Atmen gelassen werden. Die Banken genießen bei der Abwicklung von Zahlungsdiensten einen klaren Vertrauensvorsprung. Sie sollten endlich mit europaweiten innovativen Angeboten im Zahlungsverkehr aufwarten.

"2014-11-20 - BuBa - Claudia Buch.txt","It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today. Just last year, I myself was a member of the Faculty of Economics and Management at Magdeburg University, and during my short time in Saxony-Anhalt I grew very fond of the university and the town of Magdeburg. I was therefore delighted to accept Mr Strackeljan's invitation to join you in your celebration today. First of all I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the award winners.I would like to preface my remarks on this festive occasion with a note of caution by reminding you that we are facing a number of challenges at the current time. These include the worrying geopolitical developments, the uncertainty about the euro area's future course as well as problems closer to home, such as the financing of our academic centres.But I would now like to continue on a much more positive note and, at the same time, establish a common denominator between such seemingly disparate challenges. My message is that we need a strong academic - and I explicitly mean university-based - research and teaching capacity to make our country fit for the future. The answers to many of the key political and economic questions that we face can only be found on the basis of clearly structured and comprehensive analyses. Academic research and teaching are the bedrock on which such analyses and diagnoses can develop. And a clear diagnosis is the starting point from which every meaningful political concept must grow.Scientific analysis as an aid to policymaking is a broad notion that covers a wide range of activities. I would like to concentrate on examples drawn from the field of economics and, more specifically, from my current area of responsibility, namely financial stability.More than six years have now passed since the most severe economic and financial crisis since the Second World War erupted. The repercussions were and are far-reaching - even for a country such as Germany, which overcame the crisis-related economic slump relatively quickly. In the euro area the fiscal burdens stemming from the euro crisis equalled 10 percent of GDP by the end of 2013 - with bank rescue measures alone accounting for just under 7 percent of GDP. In Germany the figures were even higher, with crisis resolution measures accounting for 12 percent of GDPand bank support measures for 9 percent of GDP. By comparison, Germany's total spending on education and research in 2012 amounted to 4.3 percent of GDP.These figures graphically illustrate the political importance of seeking to make financial crises less likely and less damaging. The Federal Government consequently entrusted the Bundesbank with a new, macroprudential mandate. At the beginning of 2013, the Bundesbank's brief was thus widened to include a statutory responsibility to contribute towards safeguarding financial stability.At the European level, the Bundesbank is represented on the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The ESRB analyses the stability of the financial system and can issue warnings and recommendations, for example to national governments. This makes sense as decisions about macroprudential measures continue to be made at the national level.In Germany, macroprudential oversight is coordinated by the German Financial Stability Committee (FSC). Its voting members comprise three representatives each from the Bundesbank, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority(BaFin) and the Federal Ministry of Finance. The Bundesbank plays a special role in this committee, as it provides analyses and has a right of veto.But on what analyses and methodological approaches are these committees founded? Many claim that economic research did not produce an adequate response to the crisis, but I do not share that view. There are numerous very promising approaches aimed at gaining a better understanding of how financial crises emerge and possibly even at making them easier to predict. To my mind, however, an even bigger priority is to strengthen the resilience of the financial system and to reduce moral hazard. Modern economic research can make a crucial contribution to this.Before I move on to explain these aspects in more detail, I would like to define the term “financial stability” more precisely and examine how we can implement this policy goal.The purpose of macroprudential oversight is to improve the stability of the overall financial system. The easiest way to explain macroprudential oversight is to distinguish it from microprudential supervision, the traditional form of banking supervision. Banking supervisors monitor banks' compliance with the legal provisions applying to banks, which are in place to safeguard the stability of each individual bank. For example, banks must back their credit risk with capital in accordance with certain rules so that they can continue to meet their obligations to creditors also in the event of a loan default.The financial crisis was a dramatic reminder that the stability of individual banks is no guarantee for the stability of the entire financial system. Disruptions in markets or adverse developments at banks which, taken in isolation, were deemed manageable destabilised large parts of the financial system.Systemic crises can be generated by contagion effects. These can emerge if direct contractual obligations exist between banks that are essentially sound and others which are experiencing distress. Via these direct channels one bank's problems can spill over to many others in a domino effect.But there are also indirect contagion channels. Empirical research has shown these are frequently even more significant. Where banks have similar business models or are exposed to the same macroeconomic risk, the entire system can run into distress. If, for instance, securities held by a large number of banks all lose value at the same time, this can spell trouble. And if in such a situation banks are forced to offload these securities, they have to realise the losses resulting from such a fire-sale, which depletes their capital. This, in turn, can trigger a vicious circle comprising a credit crunch for businesses, an economic slump and a surge in defaults, thus necessitating banks to make corresponding write-downs and write-offs. Similar contagion effects can arise if a negative macroeconomic shock hits a number of banks simultaneously.In order to prevent the economy from getting trapped in such a vicious circle, macroprudential oversight has a broader focus than microprudential supervision. The objective of macroprudential oversight is not to maintain the stability of individual banks, but rather to safeguard the stability of the financial system as a whole. The purpose of financial stability policy is to ensure that the financial system remains capable of performing its macroeconomic functions also in times of crisis. Savers should be able to find suitable investment opportunities, and only those projects should be financed where the return matches the risk. In addition, the payment systems have to function smoothly at all times.Requiring banks to hold sufficient capital can mitigate the impact of such chain reactions because better capitalised banks can better absorb losses, thereby reducing the likelihood of crises that could destabilise the entire system. This is one reason why higher capital levels play such a key role in regulating banks - and not just in the stability of individual banks. Particularly large banks that are globally highly interconnected need a thick capital buffer. Corresponding proposals for the 30 largest and most important global banks to hold more capital were drawn up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and presented to the heads of state or government of the 20 most important industrialised and emerging economics - the G20 leaders - last week.However, there are other conceivable intervention measures besides capital requirements. Financial crises are the outcome of excessive indebtedness, so directly restricting bank lending or setting specific requirements for credit standards could improve systemic stability.Macroprudential oversight thus faces a range of major challenges.Financial stability is an abstract concept. Hence before any meaningful analysis can begin, the abstract objective of a more stable financial system first has to be broken down into a set of measurable indicators. I would like to illustrate this point using an analogy from monetary policy. The mandate of monetary policymakers is to maintain price stability. But, like financial stability, price stability is not something that can be measured directly. For this reason the ECB Governing Council has defined price stability as a growth rate of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of below, but close to, 2 percent. That is a quantifiable intermediate objective which can be achieved using the monetary policy toolkit.A second challenge is that “financial stability” is a rather new policy field. “Financial stability” is often not clearly defined; many instruments still need to be tested; and it is hard to predict what impact many of the measures might have. Will a given measure reduce the threat to financial stability? What evasive action might it trigger? How can we prevent macroprudential policy from being misused as a Trojan horse for market intervention aimed at protecting national markets, economic engineering or income redistribution?We can only answer these questions if we put in place a clear set of procedures for reviewing and evaluating measures that have been taken. Unlike in the past, we now have new institutions and better data at our disposal.Macroprudential oversight is now embedded in an international and a European framework. At the international level, the FSB, which I've just mentioned, explores ways in which we can refine our data pool and considers what additional regulatory measures are needed to make the international financial system less vulnerable to risk. I touched upon the institutions in Europe and Germany - the ESRB and the FSC - earlier on in my speech.The new institutions are complex, and the decision-making machinery has not yet fully clicked into gear in some instances. However, these new bodies represent a decisive step forward. A highly intensive cross-border exchange of information and experience takes place with both the FSB and the ESRB. Standards are being set that the individual countries have to comply with. And the international bodies play a key role in the coordination and evaluation of macroprudential measures.How can university teaching and economic research help us to make the financial system more stable? I would now like to outline the points that I consider most important in this area.More than in other policy spheres, the field of financial stability requires knowledge about how microeconomic decisions affect the system as a whole. The sharp distinction that we often draw in teaching and research between the micro and macro levels does not help us to understand the inner dynamics of financial systems.This interlinkage poses an exciting challenge for both empirical and theoretical work. The accusation that macroeconomists were largely caught off-guard by the crisis is therefore misleading. One could just as well argue that bank management studies did too little to flag up moral hazard stemming from banking regulation.I think both of these allegations are exaggerated. But it is true that we need to venture beyond the boundaries of our separate disciplines, and I see a number of promising approaches in this respect.There are many new approaches in macroeconomics which can model the behaviour of heterogeneous banks. The challenge will be to ensure that these models are sufficiently robust in terms of describing the frictions they model. Microeconomic approaches could provide important pointers for how to achieve this. Interestingly, microeconomics has been the source of numerous important proposals for reforming the regulatory system. And the understanding of non-linear effects which can lead to crises is also a new and promising field of research. In addition, empirical research is yielding exciting new approaches. For example, information on prices for insurance against credit risk can be used to value the credit quality of an individual entity. These data can be generated from prices for credit default swaps (CDS). New approaches can now be used to demonstrate that a bank's CDS spreads depend not only on its own fundamentals but also on those of “neighbouring” banks, which means that CDS spreads also contain a systemic component.Macroprudential policy is largely a new policy sphere, which is being established in a new institutional setting. We will therefore need to use new and innovative methods to deal with the issues that arise. And we should not tie ourselves down to particular types of analytical approaches. For example, methodologies of experimental economic research have barely featured in our financial stability analysis so far. I see highly relevant fields of application for these methods, not least for enabling us to better understand the impact of new instruments and new institutions.Much the same applies to making greater use of “big data” mining as an input into our analysis of financial system stability. For instance, information on price developments or sentiment among participants in certain markets, such as stock market or real estate markets, can be collected by trawling the internet. I believe that mixing and matching this information with conventional sources of official statistics promises to be very fruitful. Over the past few decades, the teaching of economics has moved away from institutional approaches towards model-based and mathematical approaches. I am convinced that this was the right road to follow as it put our profession on a sound scientific footing.However, institutional knowledge faded into the background in the process. The major challenge for the future is how to better combine these two elements. We need a better approach to teaching institutional frameworks without compromising analytical precision. Modern research in the area of economic history offers some very interesting ideas on how such interlinkages can be achieved.Both sides have to meet halfway. The elegant yet unrealistic analytical model will not solve our problems. Likewise, references to complex institutions which shy away from academic analysis do not help to address the challenges of our time either.Unless we establish a connection between academic methods and institutional knowledge, we will not be able to identify causality effects. All too often, the political discourse focuses on the success or failure of a given measure without any genuine impact study having been conducted. Of course, accurate impact studies will not be possible in many cases. After all, unlike many natural sciences, we have no laboratory in which to conduct our experiments. But there are still many ways in which we can come closer to identifying causal effects. We pursue these far too seldom.In order to check, for example, whether a certain (macroprudential) measure fulfils its objective, we need microeconomic information from various financial institutions. There also have to be appropriate empirical methods with which the cause and effect of a measure can be gauged as precisely as possible.We have made considerable progress in both areas. The Bundesbank has extensive data sets which we use for our own analyses and which we also allow external researchers to use. And the empirical, econometric methods, too, are much more refined today. Here, the Bundesbank can tap into its longstanding tradition of making new academic methods usable for policy analysis.Ladies and gentlemenWithout strong scientific research and teaching, we will be unable to answer key political and economic questions. Academic research and teaching are the bedrock on which the necessary analysis can be built. And good policymaking requires good analysis.I am very confident that an intensified dialogue between the fields of research and policy can succeed. The fact that we now have a significantly improved infrastructure for making sound evaluations of policy measures will undoubtedly contribute to this. Both data availability and empirical methods have improved dramatically, and corresponding analyses can be coordinated by international bodies.However, there is still significant scope to intensify the dialogue between policymaking and research. This will require a change in mindset on both sides. I, for my part, will do everything I can to ensure that this change in mentality takes place and that we create a better framework for scientific analysis as an aid to policymaking.",2014-11-20,"BuBa","Claudia Buch",2014-11-20,"Magdeburg","Germany","412.

"2014-11-21 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today at the beginning of our panel discussion. It is a pleasure to be here and to be able to share my views with you.In the following panel discussion, we will speak about the SSMand its consequences for the third parties framework. By way of introduction, I would like to share some of my thoughts on the SSM itself and its implications for a supervisory level playing field in Europe. The financial crisis has shown that banking supervision failed to keep pace with the increasingly international developments in the banking sector. Instead, banking supervision - and regulation, too - remained confined within national borders. It was the financial crisis that finally underscored the need for harmonisation in the banking supervision sphere and the need for a more harmonised regulatory approach - ideally one which would eventually create a level playing field for supervisors and banks alike. We have done a lot of work in Europe to meet these requirements - first and foremost by introducing the Single Rulebook. This package, amongst others, implements the Basel III framework and assures the harmonised implementation of the rules throughout all member states.For me, there are two watchwords for banking supervision and regulation which guide the way to a supervisory and regulatory level playing field: harmonisation and transparency. On the topic of harmonisation, the SSM will ensure that banks throughout the euro area are supervised according to a consistent set of standards. This will also enhance the effectiveness of banking supervision, because a joint supervisory approach can tackle cross-border effects more effectively than a purely national one.As for transparency, the SSM will operate on the basis of more comprehensive information, and it will benefit from cross-border comparisons and Europe-wide expertise. Pooling insights into different national and regional economic conditions, legal structures, and especially different banks' business and risk profiles, will facilitate a deeper understanding of the European banking sector. Furthermore, banking supervision at the European level will reduce the probability of national supervisors affording preferential treatment to “their” banks, thus contributing to prudential transparency.But is harmonisation an end in itself? Most certainly not: Harmonisation will always be constrained by the political and legal backdrop in the relevant jurisdiction. And in Europe, we must concede that an ideal world of a fiscal or political union is still some way off, which means that complete harmonisation remains out of reach. Ever since the EU came into being, European integration has proceeded step by step. The next step towards greater European integration was always dictated by what was feasible at the given time. These are the circumstances which all harmonisation projects in Europe need to come to terms with.  But what does all I have said about a supervisory level playing field in Europe mean for supervisors and banks?Let's begin with the supervisors: The introduction of European supervision is an extremely exciting challenge. Ever since our national supervisors began taking part in the joint supervisory teams overseeing significant banks, our tasks and perspectives have been broadened substantially. Alongside our work in the joint supervisory teams, we, as national supervisors, are still responsible for overseeing the remaining 1,800 German credit institutions that are not supervised by the SSM. I am sure that our national supervision will also benefit from the insights we gain from working in the joint European teams. But, for all the benefits it offers, European supervision also means more competition for us as national supervisors - as I mentioned earlier on, the SSMsupervisory standards will be developed by cherry-picking best practices from national approaches to banking supervision. And this is precisely where we are challenged to deliver our best practices and strategies in the prudential field.Banks, too, will certainly feel the impact of the new European level playing field in supervision. First and foremost, the SSMbanks will realise that they now operate in a more competitive environment spanning across Europe. But also non-SSM banks, the so-called less significant institutions, or LSIs, will notice changes based on SSM supervision. Even though their supervisor is still the national competent authority - here in Germany, BaFin and Bundesbank work together in this role - the SSM environment will also influence the supervision of LSIs. The LSI sector as a whole will be overseen by the ECB when it comes to risk concentration. Furthermore, the ECB may also put forward recommendations and standards for LSI supervision. Therefore, I expect a harmonisation of supervisory practices for both SSM- and Non-SSM banks. This will contribute to the supervisory level playing field in Europe and fuel greater competition among credit institutions.And in this competitive environment, German banks have a great deal of catching-up to do. The IMF's latest Global Financial Stability Report finds that the return on equity in the euro area is relatively low compared with the United States or Asia. And, with a return on equity of 1.26 percent and a return on total assets of 0.06 percent in 2013, German banks in particular are underperforming their European counterparts. Their net interest income is likewise weak by international standards.What is behind these meagre earnings? The main reason is a business model that is relatively dependent on interest income. Running a business model like that certainly poses a challenge in the current environment of low interest rates.Thus, banks will need to reconsider and adjust their business models if they are to achieve sustainable profitability. It might be worthwhile for German banks to diversify their sources of income beyond interest income. In terms of costs, German banks are faring relatively well compared with those in other countries. That being said, there is still capacity to trim costs. Streamlining branch networks or engaging in mergers might be ways of achieving this. In my view, the German banking market still offers scope for further consolidation.Ladies and gentlemenIn my remarks today, I have explained how the launch of the SSMmarks the first step towards creating a supervisory level playing field in Europe. And yet there are still challenges that lie ahead of us:First and foremost, there is the need for German banks particularly to bolster their earnings in the face of stiff European and international competition. Nevertheless, they have to be careful not to search for yield in overheating markets or to soften their lending standards too far. Other potential risks that need to be addressed are conduct of the banks themselves, which can have financial, reputational and legal consequences; IT risks both internally and from a cybersecurity point of view; losses from large corporate loans, in particular shipping loans; and disruption spilling over from mounting tensions outside the EU. All these are topics that both banks and supervisors have to give thought to.Of course, the SSM will influence not only banks and supervisors in the Euro area but also third-country banks and rating agencies, for example. In the next months, we will see how the SSM affects third-country banks, especially those European banks whose home countries are not yet participating in the SSM. I am sure that third-country banks establishing subsidiaries will benefit from the level-playing field in the Euro area. This may possibly be even a competitive advantage compared to other financial centers such as the UK. Concerning ratings, I really am curious whether the SSM will provide more confidence in the European banking sector and thereby lead to better ratings for SSM banks. These are only some of the topics I am looking forward to discussing in the following panel.",2014-11-21,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-11-21,"Frankfurt","Germany","Frankfurt 120","The SSM - A supervisory level playing field for Europe",1254,20.7,5.2,38.9,12.7,"EN"
"2014-11-21 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","I am very pleased and honoured to speak here today before such a distinguished audience. So thank you for the invitation.Since I am speaking ahead of a panel discussion entitled Banking Union and Regulatory Reforms: Mission Accomplished?, I would, if I may, like to present a central banker's view of the respective issues.The history of banking regulation is almost as old as the history of banking itself. One instance of very tough regulation was reported by the Spanish economist Huerta de Soto: in the year 1300, a detailed set of regulations to control banking were established in Catalonia.Bankers who went bankrupt were forced to live on a strict diet of bread and water until their depositors had been fully reimbursed.One would imagine that this regulation was an effective way of preventing bankers from engaging in overly risky behaviour. Apparently, it was not. In 1321, Catalonian banking regulation was tightened: henceforth, any banker who failed to meet his clients' demands faced the threat of being beheaded in front of his bank.I would say that under such a rigid regulatory regime, banking really was a risky business.Ladies and gentlemen, I can reassure the bankers among you that no regulatory authority wants to implement measures from the Middle Ages.Contemporary banking and medieval banking have as much in common as a Ferrari and a donkey cart. However, both can get into a nasty accident if their drivers navigate the roads too quickly and too recklessly.Traffic rules are there to protect drivers and their vehicles as well as other road users. You could say that the regulatory authorities are the traffic police of the financial system. With one important difference, however: Unlike a sports car that careers off the road, the failure of a commercial bank can become a systemic event.The financial crisis taught us that the rules of the banking system were insufficient. The crisis revealed a raft of regulatory weaknesses that needed to be cured: the possibility of excessive risk-taking; insufficient loss absorbing capacities; banks that were too big to fail - to name but a few of the shortcomings that came to light.During the seven years that have passed since the onset of the USsubprime crisis, significant progress has been made on the regulatory agenda. Unsurprisingly, there are mixed views on whether or not the implemented regulatory reforms are sufficient.In any case, the way representatives of the banking industry view matters is quite unlike the general public's perception: while the prevailing impression among the public at large is that next to nothing has happened, industry representatives are already complaining of a surfeit of regulation. In my opinion, neither is true. Regulation has been significantly tightened, but there can be no question of overregulation.The most important regulatory step was the introduction of stricter capital requirements and new liquidity rules under Basel III. The new capital adequacy rules that were implemented into European law by CRD IV and CRR with a transition period until 2019 require banks to hold better and more capital.According to the Basel Committee's latest Basel III monitoring exercise, most large internationally active banks already meet the fully implemented capital minimum requirements. Banks' loss absorbing capacity is much better than it was before the financial crisis.Between mid-2011 and end-2013, the average CET1 ratio of large and internationally active German banks, for example, almost doubled from just 5 percent to 9.5 percent. The leverage ratio of those banks improved from 1.7 percent to 2.6 percent.The introduction of the leverage ratio - which has a target ratio of 3.0 percent under Basel III - is without doubt a sensible supplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirements. Starting in 2015, banks will be required to disclose the leverage ratio, with a view to migrating it to a Pillar 1 requirement by 2018 after a final calibration.The leverage ratio is a useful complement as a backstop, all the more so as the Basel Committee has identified that risk weights for credit risk vary significantly across banks using an internal ratings-based approach. The risk-based approach must, however, remain a key element of the capital rules.Having a leverage ratio as the single rule would offer banks problematic incentives to take greater risks. I therefore agree with my colleague Mark Carney from the Bank of England who has said, in this context, that it is sometimes good to wear a belt and suspenders to prevent your trousers from falling down.That being said, the flaws of the risk-based approach need to be addressed. To improve the comparability of the methods used to calculate the capital requirements, the Basel Committee is aiming to curtail banks' leeway in weighting risk.For example, it is hard to assess the probability of default for low-default portfolios which include exposures to sovereigns, large companies or banks because - as the name suggests - the respective credit events are very rare.To some extent, the calculation of regulatory parameters for such low-default portfolios falls under what is known as the turkey illusion: Imagine you are a turkey. Every day you are approached by a man who feeds you. What kind of mental model of what happens when he appears do you think you'll build up? However, Thanksgiving is coming…Measures under consideration to reduce the leeway for banks using an internal-ratings based approach include the implementation of floors based on the standardised approach, restrictions on using internal estimates of certain parameters for risk calculation purposes, and the exclusion of certain asset types from the model-based approach.Efforts are also underway to make the standardised approach more risk-sensitive. However, it should be noted that using different methods to calculate risk-weighted assets is not a problem per se. To some extent, deviations are acceptable and reasonable; otherwise we would ultimately be calling into question the very rationale of the internal models-based approach.When Basel III is fully implemented, regulatory capital requirements will be significantly higher and tougher than under Basel II, and the financial system will be more stable than before. A typical credit institution will have to achieve a capital ratio of 8 percent plus various buffers. But will that be enough?To give a profound answer to this question, we would first need to have an idea of what would be an optimal, or at least an adequate, capital ratio.Academic research on this subject is not very broad. However, a recent study by several central bank economists found that a capital ratio of around 11 percent would be a reasonable figure. That number exceeds the Basel III minimum requirement but falls well short of more radical proposals.Of course, there is a trade-off between the benefits and costs of higher capital requirements which lies at the heart of the optimisation problem in the study I just mentioned. On the one hand, higher capital requirements reduce bank leveraging, the risk of bank failures and the implicit subsidies given to banks on account of deposit insurance schemes backed by the government and ultimately the taxpayer. On the other hand, excessively high capital requirements may unduly curtail banks' ability to provide credit to the economy.We should be aware that simulations like this are highly dependent on model specifications, so the results of these models need to be taken with a pinch of salt - and what is more, additional research is certainly needed in this regard. But it might encourage banks, particularly those which are currently only just managing to meet the Basel III requirements, to increase their capital beyond these requirements.One of the reasons why the banking industry usually objects to higher capital ratios is that equity is considered to be costlier than debt.There are good reasons why shareholders are better remunerated than creditors: equity is riskier than debt because debt is senior to equity and not performance-related. Moreover, equity allows shareholders to have more of a say in a company's business activities.The cost advantage of debt over equity, however, is also explained by differences in the tax treatment of various forms of investment. Equity-based financing is placed at a disadvantage to debt-based financing.Admittedly, reforming business taxation is notoriously difficult and would require a strong political commitment. Also, efficiency improvements in business taxation often go hand in hand with revenue shortfalls or acute uncertainty over the fiscal effects of legal changes.Of course, financial stability considerations are only of secondary importance in the field of business taxation. However, introducing a (more) neutral form of tax treatment for debt and equity financing would generally be efficiency-enhancing, besides reducing the attractiveness of being highly leveraged.Improving the neutrality of business taxation in terms of the source of financing appears to be a topic that is well worth considering for the reform agenda. This is not an issue specific to banks but one which generally holds true for business taxation. The task of ensuring financial institutions' capital adequacy is, nevertheless, primarily a regulatory one.Besides the Basel III regime, a host of other prudential rules have been tightened in response to the financial crisis. The stricter overall regulatory landscape has induced regulatory evasion: financial activities are being shifted out of the regulated banking sector into the unregulated shadow banking sector.According to the latest FSB Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report, non-bank financial intermediation grew by USD 5 trillion in 2013 to reach USD 75 trillion.The growing shadow banking sector is something regulators have to watch closely. Given that shadow banking entities essentially cannot tap central bank liquidity and do not benefit from backstops such as deposit insurance schemes, they are latently exposed to the risk of runs.Shadow banks can thus become a source of systemic risk, especially when they are structured to perform bank-like functions like maturity and liquidity transformation and when they are highly interconnected with the regular banking system.From a financial stability perspective it is therefore important to closely monitor shadow banks' activities and regulate them adequately. The Bundesbank therefore supports the global regulatory initiative on shadow banking under the leadership of the Financial Stability Board (FSB).The recent establishment of a European banking union, which comprises the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is an institutional milestone on the path that leads to greater financial stability in the euro area.The banking union eliminates a serious flaw in the institutional make-up of Economic and Monetary Union. In this regard, former ECB president Wim Duisenberg was already on the right track. He suggested back in the days of the Delors Group that a unified monetary policy ought to be combined with unified banking supervision.In the late 1980s, however, European politicians were not ready to take that decision. Having experienced a serious financial crisis in the euro area, this is at least one thing that has changed.Less than three weeks ago, the ECB assumed responsibility for the supervision of euro-area banks and I would like to congratulate Danièle Nouy and her staff for accomplishing the Herculean task of establishing a workable European banking supervisory set-up within one year and successfully implementing the comprehensive assessment of the largest banks. Needless to say, it would have been mission impossible if national supervisors had not acted in concert with the ECB.The SSM is expected to reduce regulatory arbitrage and remove home bias from the world of banking supervision.The Single Resolution Mechanism is a necessary complement to the common supervision set-up because it brings liability and control into alignment. To quote the European Systemic Risk Board's scientific advisers: Without credible cross-border resolution regimes, banks are ‘global in life [but] national in death'.One of the core elements of the new resolution framework will be the bail-in regime. It sets out a clear liability cascade for failing banks. In future, investors will be first in line to shoulder the costs of bank failures - and rightfully so, since they were the ones that assumed the risks and benefited from the returns in the first place.An essential requirement for the credibility of the bail-in regime is the existence of sufficient bail-in-able capital. In this regard, the G20 leaders' decision to endorse the Financial Stability Board's proposal to introduce a total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) at their meeting in Brisbane a few days ago marks an important step forward.According to the FSB proposal, the world's 30 largest banks will be required to hold TLAC in a range of 16-20 percent of their risk-weighted assets and 6 percent of their unweighted assets. The implementation of the TLAC will help to mitigate the too big to fail problem, which is a particularly relevant topic for G-SIBs.The TLAC proposal is neutral in terms of banks' structures. In order to be able to absorb losses in resolution, TLAC instruments need to be subordinated, regardless whether this is achieved via contractual, statutory or structural subordination. Moreover, comprehensive studies will be carried out to analyse the potential impact of the TLAC proposal, following which the TLAC requirement will be finalised.The euro area has already introduced a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) which applies to all institutions that are covered by the BRRD. But so far, these liabilities can be held by other financial institutions. In order to tackle the issue of contagion and thus bolster financial stability, this standard should, however, discourage other financial institutions from holding these liabilities, eg by setting limits or deductions from own funds.Therefore, I agree in essence with Goethe University's Jan-Pieter Krahnen who said in an interview with Handelsblatt last week that bail-in bonds should only be held by institutions […] that are […] able to bear the […] shock of a bank's insolvency without suffering a run themselves.Assuming the bail-in mechanism works in practice, this will also be an important step towards breaking the disastrous sovereign-bank nexus. However, more will need to be done if we are to overcome this nexus, which became a vicious cycle during the crisis.In particular, the preferential treatment afforded to sovereign bonds under the Basel III regime needs to be reconsidered. To quote Danièle Nouy: sovereigns are not risk-free assets. That has been demonstrated, so now we have to react.Putting an end to zero risk weighting and particularly applying a large exposures regime to sovereign bonds would trigger substantial repercussions, but these would be manageable if they were phased in over a transitional period - which would undoubtedly need to be granted.Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by making a reference to the title of the following panel discussion: Banking Union and Regulatory Reforms: Mission Accomplished?Without wishing to pre-empt the panel debate, I would suggest we should be cautious about declaring mission accomplished.Besides discussing individual regulatory measures, however, in my view it would be essential to consider the interplay between the various measures that have already been implemented.Without doubt, the banking sector has needed to digest sizeable shifts in the regulatory environment. This obviously needs to be considered when banks are called upon to extend their loans to the private sector. Bearing in mind the stricter capital requirements, it is not surprising that their repercussion on banks' activities make them wary when it comes to increasing their lending.That being said, the weak credit dynamics in the euro area are also caused by the moderate economic recovery and the persistent need to deleverage in the banking sector and the non-bank sector. Hence, more than just favourable refinancing conditions will be needed to stimulate credit growth.It is far more important to improve the longer-term revenue prospects of non-financial corporations. And it is important to improve sustainably job perspectives. Both can only be achieved through structural reforms which bolster competitiveness and boost economies' growth potential.A prosperous economy needs healthy banks, but the opposite is just as true: healthy banks need a prosperous economy.  ",2014-11-21,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-11-21,"Frankfurt","Germany","24th European Banking Congress","Banking union and regulatory reforms: Mission accomplished?",2643,21.9,5.2,32.9,13.9,"EN"
"2014-11-24 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","Thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity to speak here today.A popular proverb in Madrid goes as follows: De Madrid al cielo y un agujerito para verlo. My pronunciation is poor, but this certainly doesn't mean that the saying doesn't resonate with me - after all, this is already my second visit to Madrid in four months. And on both occasions, I actually had a choice in the matter, which is not always the case.In a way, the proverb also captures nicely what I'm attempting to do today - to come to Madrid in order, well, not to ascend to heaven, but to take a bird's eye view of the situation the euro area is facing. In my opinion, taking a longer-term perspective is crucial when analysing the problem that looms largest in our monetary union today: the euro area's weak growth prospects.To a certain extent, the problem is one of subdued demand, owing mostly to the macroeconomic adjustments in the countries that have been under stress over the last few years. And the subdued demand and inflation outlook are the reasons for an unprecedented degree of monetary accommodation, as Mario Draghi has put it.However, while monetary policy can influence short-term demand, it cannot permanently boost growth prospects. And the same is true, unfortunately, for fiscal policy - even if additional fiscal space would be available.When we shift our focus forward, the structural picture does not seem very bright: The European Commission estimates that the euro-area medium-term growth potential - in other words, for the next ten years - is only 1 percent. And a lower growth outlook not only means a comparatively lower standard of living, but also tighter future budget constraints.What is needed is a sustainable increase in medium-term growth. This will only come about, however, if we tackle our structural shortcomings decisively.At this point, you might argue that a lot of progress has already been made in this regard, especially in the countries worst hit by the crisis.And I would agree with you on that. A lot has indeed been done to correct the macroeconomic imbalances that are at the root of the struggle the euro area is facing.Abstracting from important cross-country differences and taking a bird's eye perspective, the divergence between prices and wages on the one hand and productivity on the other was the driving factor behind the external deficits that ultimately proved unsustainable - in addition to the precarious levels of public and private debt.When markets refused to finance the deficits any longer, the gap had to be closed. The financial support provided under the rescue mechanisms and our common monetary policy have smoothed the adjustments - without these measures, the adjustments would have been far more abrupt.Still, even in a currency union with an accommodative monetary policy and fiscal support mechanisms, national gaps between prices and productivity had to be closed - sooner rather than later.The reforms undertaken so far have made these adjustments possible. Wage negotiations, for example, have been decentralised and wage indexation has been abolished or reduced - Spain is a case in point. This makes it possible for wages to take the specific situation of each firm into account.Through this and other measures, prices and wages have been brought more in line with productivity, in a process which erased the external deficits in all crisis countries except for Cyprus in 2013. And for 2014, Cyprus is expected to post a current account surplus as well.What is more, fiscal sustainability has been improved by adjusting pensions more to demographic realities, mainly by raising the eligibility age. This strengthens the pension system financially, it preserves much needed expertise in the respective firms, and it reduces the demographic drop in labour supply to some extent. Germany has moved in this direction early on, which makes it all the more unfortunate that it now seems to backtrack somewhat on these reforms the rest of the euro area is moving towards.     As a result of the ongoing restoration of competitiveness, the euro area has now been placed on sounder footing. But while competitiveness is necessary for prosperity, it is not sufficient. Ultimately, prosperity hinges on productivity. This is where we now have to redouble our efforts.Not doing so would mean taking the pain but missing out on the gain, as Benoît Cœuré has aptly put it. The structural reforms we need now are the ones that unleash innovation and propel productivity. We also need them now because these are the reforms that can credibly raise expectations of a higher income in the future. And if income is expected to be higher tomorrow, investments will be made today. Reforms that increase supply will thus support demand as well.In some areas in need of reform, it is the European Commission who is in the driver's seat. Other areas, such as labour markets, remain a national prerogative. But even with initiatives on the European level, national governments are on board via the European Council.Political science teaches us that it can be an effective strategy in international negotiations to proclaim that your hands are tied because of domestic politics and it is either your way or the highway. But if everybody takes this logic of two level games, as the American scholar Robert Putnam has called it, to the extreme, nothing will get done. In the interest of a more prosperous monetary union, at times national sensitivities have to be put aside.Which actions are required to brighten the euro area's growth prospects? I see three areas in particular where action is needed: the financial markets, product market regulation and the labour markets.Let me start with how financial markets can channel capital into innovative companies more efficiently.Europe's biggest reform project, the banking union, is first and foremost a project about financial stability. But it is important to also see its potential ramifications for growth. By lifting the veil of uncertainty surrounding banks' balance sheets, the comprehensive assessment has helped to make the banking sector more stable. And I am quite confident that, prospectively, this will improve banks' ability and willingness to finance the real economy.Additionally, a functioning bank resolution regime with a credible bail-in of shareholders and creditors strengthens incentives for banks to carefully select and monitor the firms they lend money to. This ensures that capital will be put to its most effective use. And studies show that this is good not only for financial stability but also for growth. The evergreening of loans to non-viable firms is not a recipe to reinvigorate growth - this is the lesson of the Japanese experience in the 90s.However, history has shown that fear of contagion is a strong deterrent when it comes to actually resolving an important bank. And whether bailing in creditors would lead to contagion naturally depends on who those creditors are - if they are other financial institutions, the chances are that regulators will shy away from resolution.This is why two weeks ago, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposed minimum standards for the 30 global systemically important banks concerning both the quality and quantity of bail-in debt. In particular, it was agreed that if a bank were to hold bail-in debt issued by another systemically important bank, this would detract from its own bail-in buffer, in order to discourage banks from holding critical amounts of bail-in debt issued by other banks.The euro area already has a minimum requirement for such eligible liabilities. But so far, these liabilities can be held by other institutions without restriction. In the interests of both financial stability and growth, we should adapt the standard proposed by the FSB as soon as possible.Channelling credit into the most innovative and efficient companies is a crucial prerequisite for growth. But in their infancy, companies are usually not looking for credit, but for equity investors. When it comes to providing capital to innovative firms, the EU has much room for improvement. In the US, for instance, finding investors is not much of a problem for innovative companies. An innovative American firm is able on average to attract twice as much capital as an innovative firm in Spain, France, or Germany. Investment in a new, innovative firm often takes the form of venture capital. The business model of a venture capital fund is based on developing expertise in a certain area and using this expertise to make informed bets on a number of promising firms in the industry in question. A high number of new firms fail, but the rewards to be reaped if they succeed are also high - on average, venture capital investments in the US have delivered a return of around 13 percent since 1990, according calculations by the Economist.For the venture capital model to work there has to be a minimum market size in order to be able to spread out investments among a large enough number of start-ups. But in Europe, the markets for venture capital have been segmented along national borders. This may go some way to explaining why in Europe, investments by venture capital funds in technology companies are only one-fifth the size of investments in the US.The Single Market Act of 2011 set out to harmonise venture capital regulations and to create a more integrated market. But many domains relevant to venture capital funds, such as investor protection and insolvency law, remain fragmented.In order to make up for the lack of private capital, the EU installed a public venture capital fund at the EIB in 1997. Similar vehicles exist at the national level as well. The Economist estimates that up to 40 percent of European venture capital now comes from public sources. But the risk-return profiles of the companies targeted by these investments would appear to differ from those funded by US venture capital funds - the average return on venture capital since 1990 is no more than 2.1 percent.This could suggest that public funds might not be able to make up for the fragmented market for venture capital in Europe. Instead, more integration seems to be the most likely way of making venture capital pay off, and of providing innovative companies with the funding they need.Ladies and gentlemen, more integration is not only needed with regard to the venture capital market, but also with regard to the markets their investments operate in.When it comes to the market that arguably has the most sweeping consequences for overall productivity - I am referring to Information Technologies (IT) - fragmentation still abounds. This applies in particular tolegal issues such as privacy and data protection, content and copyright, liability of online intermediaries, e-payments and electronic contracts. The EU still comprises 28 individual digital markets rather than one single digital market.This is holding back innovation, growth and, ultimately, jobs. Studies suggest that establishing a harmonised and well-regulated digital single market holds the same potential as the introduction of the original one, and could raise GDP by as much as 4 percent. In Germany, for example, this could imply an additional 420,000 jobs over the period 2015 to 2020.A truly integrated digital market also implies higher potential rewards for investing in a digital European start-up. Together with the reforms outlined before, this might create a critical mass for venture capital in Europe. Bringing the single market into the digital age therefore could amount to a buy one, get one free scenario.A bigger market makes it more attractive for any potential entrant to compete on it. And more intense competition spurs innovation. In the long term, innovation due to increased competition is the main reason why market integration raises welfare.But for newcomers to be able to challenge incumbents, they must not trip over red tape. Unfortunately, bureaucratic barriers to setting up a business are still high in many European countries - not least in Germany, which ranks 114th in the World Bank's Doing Business report in this regard. Spain does comparatively better, ranking 74th. But this still implies a considerable distance to the frontier of best practice. How large is the impact of barriers to entry on the overall economy? Research suggests: quite large indeed. Increasing entry costs from very low levels such as those observed in Denmark, for example, to moderate ones like those in Spain can reduce per capita GDP and total factor productivity by up to 10 percent. And the small differences in the administrative cost of entry between Europe and the US seem to explain 10 to 20 percent of Europe's lag vis-à-vis the US with regard to total factor productivity and the capital-output ratio.Removing barriers to entry therefore holds the promise of substantial gains in productivity and welfare. But these barriers can be tackled not only at the national level, but on the European level as well.The single market has been very successful in facilitating trade in goods. Hence, competition in this area is intense. The mark-ups that firms are able to charge in addition to their costs due to market power are low and are comparable to those in the US, for example.When it comes to services, however, the picture looks different. Mark-ups are higher, on average, than in the US. It is probably safe to say that the Services Directive has fallen short of expectations. This could be changed by finally establishing the country of origin principle in the services sector, as is already the case in the common market for goods. This principle states that a firm should no longer be hampered by regulation in the import country if it has already complied with the national regulations in its home country.Such a move would make services markets more open to competition. And reducing barriers to entry to more than two-thirds of the overall EU economy could provide a real boost to productivity.Ladies and gentlemen, barriers to market entry can exert a powerful drag on productivity. But productivity is not only held back by product market regulations. For productivity to flourish, we need resources to flow - to the most innovative and efficient firms. This is why creating a working European venture capital market is very important.Here, another factor comes into play: On average, bigger firms tend to be more productive and are better placed to compete in export markets. Unfortunately, the growth of small, innovative companies is hindered in some European countries by a plethora of regulations that kick in at a certain size threshold.In France, for instance, many regulations become binding when a firm reaches a size of 50 employees. This causes some firms which would otherwise expand to stay below that level. Research suggests that this distortion leads to a loss of 4-5 percent of French GDP. Other size-contingent regulations exist in other countries such as Portugal or Italy, where the threshold is 15 employees. What these regulations all have in common is that they deter firms from expanding. Therefore, they are a drag on growth.  These examples show that capital is not the only indispensable input for firms. Labour is equally crucial. Studies indicate that, compared to the US, innovative European firms have considerably more difficulties in attracting the staff they need. This lowers allocative efficiency and, ultimately, productivity. The reason for this seems to be that overly strict employment protection exerts a lock-in effect: Workers do not move easily from firm to firm.This not only hampers productivity, but is of particular concern in a monetary union. After all, the theory of optimum currency areas suggests that, in the absence of the exchange rate as an adjustment variable, we need the flexible movement of labour to absorb economic shocks.How can we improve the situation? Simply slashing worker protection cannot be the answer. But when exploring avenues to make labour markets more flexible and efficient, we might heed the advice of the Nobel-winning labour economist Chris Pissarides: Protect workers, not jobs. In other words, less stringent employment protection coupled with adequate financial support in the event of a job loss is likely to reduce overall unemployment, while still insuring workers against the vagaries of the market.The crushingly high unemployment levels - and especially youth unemployment levels - in some countries such as Spain are really a tragedy. These unemployment levels are more than enough reasons on their own to improve the workings of the respective labour markets. The spectre of a lost generation is economically indefensible and morally repulsive. In this situation, vested interests have to take a back seat.And reforms that improve job prospects for the unemployed would have the additional upshot of making it easier for innovative firms to find the skills they need. This will make the overall economy more productive.Scandinavian countries have led the way with flexicurity-type reforms. More recently, Spain has also taken some steps in this direction, and we can see that employment in highly productive industries such as manufacturing and in professional, scientific, and technical activities is growing.Last month, Italy's senate passed reforms that would go some way towards a single labour contract, advocated for example by this year's Nobel Prize winner Jean Tirole. Such a contract would improve protection for temporary workers while somewhat lowering protection for those with permanent contracts that have been almost impossible to terminate hitherto. This addresses labour market duality and, coupled with unemployment insurance reform, resembles the reforms I have just outlined. But so far, the measures are still awaiting confirmation by parliament.In any case, the scope for flexicurity-type reforms in Europe remains broad. If we want to emulate the productivity of the USand bring unemployment down to acceptable levels, we need to modernise our labour markets. Crucially, modernisation does not mean every man for himself. But it does mean that labour markets have to be more elastic.Ladies and gentlemen, let me come to a close. The biggest problem besetting the euro area today is its dim growth prospects. While weak demand does currently play a role, and this is why our monetary policy is more accommodative than ever before, we need to face up to our structural shortcomings to unleash innovation and propel productivity.A financial sector that channels capital into the most innovative and efficient firms, reforms that make it easier for new firms to compete, and flexible labour markets that protect workers instead of jobs and allow firms to attract the skilled employees they need are the cornerstones that, if combined, have the potential to transform the growth outlook.The OECD estimates that such measures have the potential to lift growth up to 15 percent above the current baseline level after ten years. And some of this would be felt instantly, as the expectation of higher incomes tomorrow triggers stronger investment today.There is no single reform that will provide a silver bullet - and more needs to be done not only with regard to growth, but also in terms of the euro area's fiscal framework. But I already outlined why - from a stability point of view - it is so important to rebalance liability and control in Europe during my last visit to Madrid. And I do not wish to repeat myself.Still, if we embark on a comprehensive overhaul in the way I have just described, I am positive that our monetary union will not only continue to fulfil the promise of price stability, but will live up to the promise of prosperity as well. Even that kind of euro area might not be heaven, but the view from above would be much nicer than it is today.",2014-11-24,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-11-24,"Madrid","Spain","AMF Jahrestagung 2014","Towards a more prosperous monetary union",3268,19.9,4.9,42.4,12.2,"EN"
"2014-11-25 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","I am delighted to present the 2014 Financial Stability Review, which I am doing for the first time together with Deputy President Professor Buch. This press conference also marks a personal first for me, as, in this context, it is my first in my new role as the Executive Board member responsible for banking supervision. In addition to my previous experience in the private sector, my move from the field of financial stability to banking supervision in May 2014 means that I can see things from many different perspectives - something for which I am thankful.And we have another premiere: this is the first Financial Stability Review to be published since the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) was launched. Under the new European supervisory structure, the ECB assumed direct supervision of the 120 most significant euro-area banks on 4 November.Ms Buch has already discussed many important aspects of the Financial Stability Review, which I will now expand upon by taking a look at the current risk situation of the German banking sector. The comprehensive assessment began just one year ago. This involved subjecting the major German institutions to closer scrutiny and testing their ability to withstand stress in a crisis situation. The objective was to create transparency and to detect any legacy problems and capital shortfalls. Elke König, President of BaFin, and I gave a detailed account of the results back at the end of October.You will recall that 24 of the 25 German institutions that participated in the comprehensive assessment passed, with the only bank to fail having already closed the capital shortfall identified in the comprehensive assessment.From a German perspective, we can therefore state that the ECB's prelude to the SSM in the form of the comprehensive assessment was an overall success. Much the same as a play or an opera, however, it takes more than one successful overture to secure a bank's long-term success.Therefore, banks cannot afford to rest on their laurels based on this positive outcome, as several banks barely cleared the 5.5 percent capital hurdle in the stress test's adverse scenario.Furthermore, five German banks would not have passed the stress test if it had been based on full implementation of the Basel III rules, which will apply from 2018 onwards. What this shows not least is: German banks cannot afford to stand still. Last but not least, Germany also has a some catching-up to do with regard to the leverage ratio. Although this non-risk-weighted capital ratio has improved in recent months - 20 of the German banks that participated in the comprehensive assessment are already compliant with the 3 percent leverage ratio figure, which will be in effect from 2018 onwards - German banks are still performing relatively poorly by international standards.Let us now analyse the current situation of the German banking sector.In addition to a high level of resilience - as confirmed by the comprehensive assessment - banks also need, not least, to be successful in terms of sustainable profitability in order to be able to hold their own in the market in the long run.So what can we ascertain from banks' earnings situation? Let us take a look at something of vital importance to German banks: interest income. This continues to be characterised by the ongoing phase of low interest rates.German banks' business models rely strongly on interest income, relatively speaking. When interest rates are low, this naturally puts pressure on earnings. For instance, in the first half of this year, the operating income of 11 German banks with an international focus was roughly 8 percent down year-on-year. This decline was largely driven by falling net interest income and a drop in net trading income.Viewed in relation to the German banking system as a whole, the impact of low interest rates currently remains limited. Savings banks and credit cooperatives, in particular, managed to bolster net interest income by increasing lending business volumes.However, if interest rates remain at current levels for the foreseeable future, the pressure on earnings will intensify further: maturing higher-yielding loans would then have to be rolled over into lower-yielding loans. As it is almost impossible to lower deposit rates any further in many cases, it could be worth considering expanding lending business to counter the fall in net interest income. A protracted period of low interest rates, moreover, could spark a greater risk appetite among low-earning institutions, in particular.Furthermore, a cross-sectional analysis of German institutions reveals a high degree of synchronisation with regard to interest rate risk. The Bundesbank has addressed this point as part of a macro stress test conducted on small and medium-sized institutions, which simulated various paths of interest rate movement.An abrupt interest rate increase and a flattening of the yield curve are the scenarios which would weigh most heavily on banks' net interest income. This is attributable to term transformation.The strains caused by a rise in interest rate would particularly lead to a stability problem if other macroeconomic risks were to materialise simultaneously. Banks need to equip themselves to deal with this by ensuring they have adequate capital buffers.Developments in this regard are positive. For instance, German banks have improved their resilience by raising new equity and retaining earnings. The visible overall drop in the Tier 1 capital ratio is attributable to the stricter regulatory requirements of CRD IV and the CRR. Since we began carrying out our Basel III impact study in 2011, the average Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the largest German banks has risen to 9.3 percent, almost doubling.Please allow me to outline an additional aspect of the banking system's current situation. Global regulation and European supervision are contributing to the level playing field that has been called for and which is necessary. But this also means that German banks are increasingly facing up to international comparison.In its most recent Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF warns that, in terms of return on equity and return on total assets, German banks languish well below average in both an international and a European comparison. German banks lag far behind their foreign competitors in terms of the diversification of their earnings, in particular. Effectively, this means that the German banking sector needs to press ahead with the expansion of non-interest income as a percentage of total earnings in order to be able to hold its own when competing for clients and investors in the long run.In the past months, banks have cleansed their balance sheets of many legacy issues and strengthened their capital base. The measures taken thus far to strengthen resilience are very much to be welcomed. However, German banks are by no means “out of the woods” yet.  So where should the focus of such efforts be placed? On the one hand, with regard to improving resilience, risk provisioning always needs to be brought into line with the prevailing economic environment. On the other, methods of further increasing capital levels, for example by retaining profits, need to be explored. German banks need to review their business models - not least given overcapacity in the banking market.There are perhaps some people who are wondering what the Bundesbank's role will be in the new supervisory structure. Will it be the ECB that, together with Ms Buch, presents the banking chapter of the Financial Stability Review in future?Take it from me, everything will remain in experienced hands in this regard. We will - naturally - lose a little bit of our influence on the 21 banks which will be supervised by the ECB in future. On the other hand, we will gain some influence among the 99 foreign banks, as the President of the Bundesbank will also have a say in decisions, even those concerning other European banks, on the ECB's Governing Council.Through our direct involvement in the off-site supervision of SSMbanks as well as our continuing responsibility for the off-site supervision of small and medium-sized banks, the Bundesbank's involvement in the supervision of banks will continue undiminished - in the framework of our tried and tested cooperation with BaFin.And our cooperation with BaFin was particularly good during the comprehensive assessment, for which I would like to thank our colleagues at BaFin very much.Although we at the Bundesbank would have wished for a somewhat different legal basis for the future division of European supervisory tasks with BaFin, we naturally repsect the compromise that has been reached and, in future, will cooperate as closely and harmoniously with BaFin as we have in the past - and the same goes for our cooperation with the ECB.In this strong role, we will continue to deliver clear assessments of the risk situation of the German banking sector, but also, I expect, increasingly of the European banking sector as well. Today's first Financial Stability Review following the inauguration of the SSM is therefore certainly anything but a curtain call.",2014-11-25,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-11-25,"Frankfurt","Germany","Press Conference on the Publication of the Bundesbank's Financial Stability Report","The risk situation in the German financial system",1481,22.7,5,39,13.4,"EN"
"2014-11-25 - BuBa - Claudia Buch.txt","Today is the ninth time the Deutsche Bundesbank is presenting its Financial Stability Review. For some of you here today, this is no doubt a routine event. But for me it's something of a first. So I am particularly delighted to welcome you all here today.Even though the Bundesbank has published its Financial Stability Review on nine occasions now, the task of safeguarding financial stability is actually a new statutory mandate that has been given the Bundesbank. It was only last year that the German federal government established the Financial Stability Committee. The decisions made by this committee are based on analyses prepared by the Bundesbank. The bank is likewise a member of major committees at the European level which deal with financial stability matters.The Bundesbank defines financial stability as the financial system's ability to perform its key macroeconomic functions, and particularly so in periods of stress and upheaval.This is naturally a very broad definition that needs to be fleshed out in greater detail. We do this by focusing on two crucial questions:Are investment decisions being distorted by moral hazard? This moral hazard can arise from implicit or explicit government guarantees, for instance. But equally, it can also emanate from low interest rates and an ample supply of liquidity by central banks. This spurs investors to search for higher yields - even if it means taking on the elevated risks associated with these superior yields.This brings me straight to the second question: How well equipped is the financial system to fend off risks that materialise? Capital plays an absolutely vital role in this regard. After all, the more capital a bank has, the more stable is not just the individual bank, but also the entire financial system, and the better it is shielded against the risk of revaluations - meaning greater stability all round.It is for this reason that the Financial Stability Review seeks to identify signs of potential systemic instability early on. We examine whether the financial system is sufficiently resilient to withstand a number of downside scenarios.So what are the main findings of the Financial Stability Review? There are incentives for investors to engage in riskier behaviour in the current low-interest-rate environment. As things stand, this is particularly the case in the corporate bond and syndicated loan segment. As for banks' ability to bear risks, the picture is less clear. German banks today are better capitalised than they were just a few years ago, but their profitability remains weak. This is why the Financial Stability Review takes a particularly close look at the situation in the housing market - after all, this sector has often been the primary source of critical developments in the past. Mortgage lending in Germany is not a highly procyclical phenomenon. This is to be welcomed, since it dampens the risk of overvaluation from this side. Yet banks are structurally vulnerable to changes in prices, so we will continue to keep a very close eye on developments in the real estate markets. The banking union helps to better identify risks and to force the private sector to absorb a share of losses. A key component - from a financial stability angle - is the Single Resolution Mechanism. In future, private sector owners and creditors are to be forced to shoulder the cost of restructuring or resolving banks. But the banking union alone will be unable to loosen the sovereign-bank nexus because sovereign exposures continue to enjoy privileged regulatory treatment. This preferential treatment therefore needs to be brought to an end over a medium to long-term horizon. The financial crisis swept away any lingering doubts that the close financial ties between banks and sovereigns can pose a threat to financial stability. This is another area, then, in which we should not create any misguided incentives to take on excessive risk.I would like now to outline these findings in greater detail.Risk premiums on corporate bonds are currently very narrow. At times in 2014, risk premiums for non-investment grade paper in the euro area were no more than just under 300 basis points. So they came very close to the lowest levels seen in the pre-crisis era. We used these spreads to calculate implied default rates, which are lower than the historical norm. This suggests that risk is being underestimated - all the more so when one considers the frail state of the economy.Broadly speaking, we see signs that enterprises are increasingly sourcing debt capital from outside the banking sector. This might be a sensible response to ongoing structural adjustments in the banking sector. But raising debt capital can pose a fresh set of risks because more capital makes enterprises more resilient. In this respect, firms are no different from banks. As a case in point, the capital ratio of German enterprises has climbed from just under 20 percent to just shy of 30 percent in the last ten years, which means that enterprises are more resilient to shocks.The signs of significant overvaluation are less clear-cut in the equity markets than in the bond market. Volatility in these markets is relatively low, however. Investors might, then, feel inclined to extrapolate the current favourable setting into the future, presuming it to be the normal state of affairs - and turn a blind eye to a possible end to this quiet spell. Were this to occur, an abrupt and massive change in asset prices might disrupt the proper functioning of the entire financial system. As we have seen in the financial crisis, this might also cause liquidity to dry up.This brings me to the banking sector. We believe that it's important for German banks and insurers to ready themselves for a possible end to the period of calm. For the most part, German banks are currently busy reducing risk and building up capital. Their resilience has improved. German insurers, meanwhile, continue to follow a relatively conservative investment strategy. However, they are affected by low interest rates owing to their high guaranteed payments.Given that banks are now better capitalised, they presumably might be able to withstand isolated shocks relatively well. But German banks' profitability remains persistently weak. Ever since the 1990s, their interest margin has been diminishing - and with it, their ability to build up fresh capital by retaining earnings. The current low interest rates are amplifying this state of affairs because at the present time, banks are still reaping the benefits of the higher-yielding loans they granted in the past. But one by one, these loans are maturing.Because mortgage loans account for much of the credit supplied to the private sector, this was a market we scrutinised particularly closely. Price dynamics in Germany over the past 20 years have been much more modest than in the euro area as a whole. But saying that, property prices in big cities really have climbed quite sharply - by just over a third since 2008 in the big cities most affected by this trend: Berlin, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Munich and Stuttgart.From a financial stability angle, two factors are crucial in this respect: developments over time, and the risk level.Low interest rates might fuel demand for mortgage loans, which might give rise to a self-reinforcing interaction between lending and prices. However, the results of a Bundesbank survey of banks have indicated that the risks inherent in real estate business are hardly procyclical. All in all, mortgage loans grew at no more than a modest pace - at 2 percent per year, to be precise - while lending standards have hardly been loosened.What we do see, though, are signs of structural vulnerability within the German banking system. The surveys found that 100 percent financing arrangements are certainly no longer out of the ordinary in the surveyed towns and cities. If a decline in urban real estate prices were to coincide with climbing default rates, this would have a considerable impact on banks' profits. A scenario like this might well be manageable, were it to occur in isolation. But experience has taught us that real estate crises normally go hand in hand with a downturn in the broader economy. If this occurred simultaneously, it could prove to be very trying indeed for banks.Besides continuing to monitor developments in the real estate market, we currently see two areas in which action is needed. First, we are laying the groundwork for closing major data gaps. Second, we are evaluating what fundamental legislation is needed to even more effectively counter risk in the real estate market going forward.We have taken a huge step forward at the European level this year. The European Single Supervisory Mechanism can apply a consistent and strict standard of supervision and compare banks across national borders, meaning that risks to financial stability can be identified earlier on. While it is true that it is primarily the nation states which decide on the use of macroprudential instruments, the European Central Bank, too, has been given macroprudential powers, and it can tighten national regulations. That makes sense and averts the danger of not addressing risks to financial system stability in good time.But the banking union also provides answers to another key question: who is to bear risks that have materialised? In the pre-crisis era, there were no effective procedures for dealing with major banks that had run into difficulties. All too often, the cost of risks that materialised were passed on to the taxpayer, while private sector owners and creditors were hardly ever made liable.Looking ahead, the Single Resolution Mechanism, the centrepiece of which is the bail-in instrument, will provide an improved toolkit for dealing with struggling banks, thus ensuring that private sector owners and creditors will be forced to share the cost of restructuring or resolving banks.If banks sustain losses in the future, private funds will have to be used to absorb these losses in accordance with a clearly defined liability cascade. Only if these funds are insufficient will it be possible to take recourse to the European Single Resolution Fund (SRF), which is financed by the banks themselves. Public finances can only be used as a last resort.The new regime also allows exceptions to be made from the bail-in rule if financial system stability is otherwise in jeopardy. The resolution authorities are exposed to a conflict of interest. On the one hand, strict implementation of creditor liability can produce contagion effects and, potentially, destabilise the system. On the other hand, every time an exception is made to the rule, it increases the likelihood that public money will need to be deployed, amplifying the moral hazard in the system. That is why discretionary scope needs to be used responsibly. Exceptions should be confined to rare, clearly defined instances. Otherwise, the seeds of growing risk in the future would be sown under the guise of protecting systemic stability.One of the avowed aims of the banking union is to sever the sovereign-bank nexus. This mutual dependence became even more intense during the crisis. Government financial crises had an adverse impact on banks' credit quality; struggling banks placed a strain on public finances. The brunt of this was borne by enterprises which had less access to credit.The banking union can help to make the private sector more liable for losses. It does not, however, do anything to change the regulatory setting. Government bonds are the subject of preferential capital requirements; there are exceptions to the large exposure limits; and government bonds will received privileged treatment in the liquidity regulation in future.This preferential treatment needs to be brought to an end over a medium to long-term horizon. Only then will it be possible to separate the risks of banks and sovereigns, once and for all. That is not something which the banking union alone can achieve.",2014-11-25,"BuBa","Claudia Buch",2014-11-25,"Frankfurt","Germany","Press Conference on the Publication of the Bundesbank's Financial Stability Report","Presentation of the 2014 Financial Stability Review",1961,18.4,5,46.8,11.1,"EN"
"2014-11-27 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today and thus to be able to accept the invitation which Mr Bender and Ms Reinhardt-Lehmann sent me some time ago.Not only did planning ahead play a role in finding a date for today's economic talk, it will also be the central theme of my remarks today. As you will no doubt have gathered from the invitation, I would like to talk to you today about the demographic challenges that Germany faces, a topic which is also likely to be familiar to you by another name: the ageing of the population.On the subject of ageing, the American poet Ezra Pound once said, The older one gets, the more one appreciates the art of constructive silence. In this regard, it appears that I am obviously not yet old enough. And what is more, silence is not particularly entertaining, especially if you have been invited to deliver a speech.The subject of ageing makes most of us uneasy, both with a view to ourselves and to society as a whole. This is probably mainly because getting older is unavoidable and, as well as ideally bringing the wisdom that comes with old age, is also associated with other, more negative side effects. And anyway, who wants to resign themselves to the inevitable? But it is precisely because it is inevitable that we must face up to it.For the next few minutes, I would therefore like to show you, from an economic perspective, how demographic change in Germany will develop, what macroeconomic impact it may have and how policy-makers should try, as far as possible, to deal with this impact. The political response to the demographic challenge will help to decide whether the German economy can retain its leading position in many areas.Let me first briefly outline the demographic trends that await us, with the help of the Federal Statistical Office's 12th coordinated population projection from 2009.Based on certain assumptions regarding the birth rate, life expectancy and net immigration, the Federal Statistical Office predicts that, by 2060, Germany's population will shrink by up to 20 percent from today's figure. Although we know that Germany has become more attractive to immigrants since this study was published, we also know that immigration can only cushion the demographic process in Germany, not prevent it.However, even more important than the contraction process in itself is the fact that the decrease in the population is accompanied by a distinct ageing of society. One of the reasons for the ageing of the population and the shift in the balance between young and old is, of course, that life expectancy is expected to carry on increasing, which is certainly a positive development for those concerned. However, the fact that the numbers of younger people are decreasing sharply is having a much larger impact. In comparison to 2008, the decline in Germany's birth rate will almost triple by 2060.Similarly, the working-age population will contract significantly and will also age. In other words, there will be fewer people of working age and considerably larger numbers of elderly people in future. Or, to quote a comparison once made by the demographer Herwig Birg, Our country is like a rowing boat. The number of rowers is falling, while the number of older passengers will increase for a number of decades.Ladies and gentlemen, the demographic trends I have just outlined have basically already been evident for a long time and are practically irreversible. For example, even if the birth rate were to rise again significantly in the medium term, the trend towards a shrinking and ageing population over the next few decades would not be reversed. The reason that the demographic trend is so strong is that, because Germany's birth rate has been falling for decades, those who would now perhaps be thinking about having children were never actually born.Even though demographic forecasts are somewhat uncertain by nature, the demographic trend is clear and we must ask ourselves how we intend to tackle it using social policy and what implications it will have for economic policy. I would now like to focus on this second point in particular, highlighting various areas and pointing out possible courses of action for each. Let us first consider the labour market.As the working-age population shrinks, the total number of hours that can be worked also decreases, which has a dampening effect on aggregate output and therefore on gross domestic product. The first implication of this trend for economic policy is obvious. To counteract the decrease in the number of hours worked, we need measures that raise Germany's labour force participation.In Germany, reserves for this are most likely to be found among the elderly and people with family commitments. Measures aimed at improving the work-life balance are therefore a step in the right direction in terms of both social and economic policy.Looking at the elderly population, the decision made a few years ago to gradually raise the retirement age to 67 also helped to keep people in this age group in work for longer. Labour force participation among the over-60s has already risen significantly over the last few years.However, allowing workers to draw a full pension after 45 years of contributions has now somewhat blurred the signal sent out by raising the retirement age to 67. Retirement at 63 is something which favours age groups that are currently close to retirement to the detriment of younger generations. This brings to mind a quote by the American comedian, Groucho Marx, who died almost forty years ago: Why should I care about future generations? What have they ever done for me?But retirement at 63 is not only a step in the wrong direction in terms of our demographic challenges. In the short term, it also means that workers who are still needed in the labour market are retiring. The shortage of skilled workers is already inhibiting growth in many regions of Germany. Companies in the Rhine-Main region now also appear to be expressing support for bonuses for workers who find them new employees.Ladies and gentlemen, given the ever decreasing number of skilled workers in Germany, the topic of immigration has attracted more and more attention over the past few years. I have already spoken briefly about the pleasing development of stronger, labour market-oriented immigration.And, in fact, encouraging the immigration of skilled workers is a useful economic policy to combat the growing shortages on the labour market and to better meet the demand for qualified employees. But, on a realistic scale, immigration of this kind can only mitigate the demographic change taking place in Germany - it cannot stop or even reverse the trend. However, as a society, we should certainly remain open to the rest of the world and thus continue to be an attractive choice for people who decide to live and work in Germany.Ladies and gentlemen, aggregate output depends not only on how many hours are worked, of course, but also on labour productivity. Given that the ageing effect I have already mentioned is also taking place among the labour force, we must ask ourselves how this group's labour productivity is likely to develop. Is it true that productivity drops as the labour force ages, as has often been suggested?The answer appears to be no. More recent empirical studies in this area suggest that the level of labour productivity of employees who are getting older is likely to remain largely the same. Although physical and cognitive capacities generally decrease with age, they are compensated for by growing professional and practical experience. As a result, the contrasting productivity effects are likely to more or less balance each other out. Or, in a nutshell, the young can run faster but the old know the shortcuts.But this does not mean that overall productivity will remain unaffected by demographic change in the long term. Growing fiscal burdens and a potential decrease in innovation may have a restraining effect. As well as measures to increase aggregate productivity through greater competition and stronger technological progress, measures aimed at increasing labour productivity in the economy are also needed. Such measures would at least cushion the negative impact of demographic change.Qualifications and education are - and will remain - a cornerstone of this, in addition to an economy's capacity for innovation and thus its technological progress. It cannot be said often enough: education and innovation - supplemented, of course, by curiosity and the urge to explore and discover - are the crucial driving forces behind human and economic development. They therefore play a key role in increasing the growth potential of the economy. In an ageing society, each individual must retain their ability and willingness to be open to new ideas.For education and innovation to actually fuel progress, society must be free, democratic, competitive and growth-inducing. Expanding knowledge and education will require an education system that meets high standards which are comparable across Germany and which will give children, teenagers and young adults the breathing room and the assistance necessary to develop their talents to the fullest.Studies show that adolescent educational achievement in Germany is closely correlated with social background, which also impacts on subsequent employment prospects. This contradicts an important social principle - equal opportunities for all members of society - and is damaging in terms of economic policy. Because educational achievement in later life is often decided mainly at the pre-school stage, it makes sense to increase the resources spent on education for infants and pre-school students and to devote more public funding to it than in the past.Ladies and gentlemen, when we look at things from an economic perspective, what is known as potential growth is a particularly relevant factor. Potential growth is normally defined as the aggregate growth that can be achieved when utilisation of all production factors is normal over time.Economic potential growth cannot be observed directly, meaning it cannot be measured directly either. Instead, it has to be estimated as precisely as possible. I don't intend today to go into the methods used and the imponderables they entail. However, I think the connection between demographic trends and economic potential growth can be summed up with the following words. Regardless of the uncertainty surrounding estimates of this kind over long periods of time, German potential growth is likely to be weaker in future than in past decades due, above all, to the demographics-driven decline in the number of hours worked.And yet, the question does arise in this context whether, given the declining and ageing society, the expansion rates of past decades can serve as a suitable yardstick for advanced economies.Ultimately, however, this has been a valid question in Germany for quite some time now. If we compare the average growth rates of the last few decades, we find a consistently downward trend. In the 1970s we were at just under three per cent. Since the turn of the century, it has been little more than one per cent on the whole.Thus, when looking ahead, it would probably be more useful to adopt a per capita perspective and compare Germany's relative growth position with that of similar countries.But such a forward-looking comparison does not put Germany in a particularly good light either. According to estimates by the OECD in its report entitled Looking to 2060, the German economy will generate the second slowest growth of all 42 countries in the study in the period up to 2030, and the slowest growth up to 2060. Per capita growth looks somewhat better because of the falling population. However, here too, Germany is mired in mediocrity by European standards, according to the OECD.Faced with these prospects, our economic policy-makers would do well to follow the path of sustained growth all the more vigorously and hence to fight back. To this end, measures need to be taken which heighten the ability primarily of the private sector to adapt, innovate and invest.There are ultimately a number of different approaches towards achieving those objectives. These include the areas I have already looked at, namely the labour market, immigration, education and the capacity to innovate. To this list I would add the physical infrastructure.It goes without saying that an efficient infrastructure is vital for economic development. International comparisons show that Germany does indeed have a good infrastructure overall, particularly in the transport sector. However, if we turn our attention away from the overall picture to the details of the individual components, shortcomings or constraints in infrastructure are clearly evident in some regions, while overcapacities may exist elsewhere.In the public debate, clear calls have been made for higher investment expenditure. But in order to use taxpayers' money prudently and maximise the value added for society, more public funds should be spent only after thoroughly weighing up the costs and benefits of a specific infrastructure project. Not every investment undertaking is worth the money, as you as entrepreneurs know all too well. And that applies to public investment as much as it does to private investment.At the same time, higher public investment spending should be counter-financed by making savings elsewhere. Because demographic change also makes heavy demands of public finance - and I will come back to that in a moment.Ladies and gentlemen, to promote growth and competition more strongly also requires measures that make business start-ups easier and remove barriers to market entry. A constituent element of our market economy is that enterprises must also be allowed to fail and, in consequence, to exit the market. At the end of the day, only if entrepreneurs are held liable for their business decisions will they make those decisions responsibly.Yet it is crucial for market processes that new enterprises step in to replace those that fail. The economist Joseph Schumpeter, who died in 1950, called this concept “creative destruction”. Where no new businesses are set up, however, a market economy loses its creativity - with negative implications for innovation and growth as well as for employment and income opportunities.There is still considerable scope in Germany to facilitate new business start-ups, as is shown - for instance - by the table the World Bank prepares once a year as part of its Doing Business report. In the sub-category of the report that compares the time, cost and procedures involved in setting up a new business, Germany ranks a lowly 114th - faring markedly worse than many other euro-area countries.Conversely, this means that measures to ease the process of establishing a new business and, where necessary, of removing red tape, are unlikely to cost much money, yet would boost growth potential appreciably.Ladies and gentlemen, when we talk of setting up new businesses, the question of financing them is never far away. Because young innovative enterprises entail a higher level of economic risk, they need capital more than anything else. From a growth perspective, therefore, measures would probably be useful which promote investors' willingness to put up venture capital.In this context, Europe-wide - which is to say cross-border - efforts would certainly be the most promising. The venture capital market here in Europe is in poor shape, unlike in the United States, for example. One of its weaknesses is that it is often still segmented along national borders - a situation that different investor protection and insolvency regimes help to perpetuate.And with regard to the willingness to raise capital, the fact that business tax laws in Germany provide for different tax treatment of debt and equity capital is not very helpful either.Moreover, growth forces could be mobilised by applying at the European level the principles of the single market more strongly to the market for services, and by bringing the single market into the digital age. Ladies and gentlemen, strengthening growth forces is also an issue of great relevance for public finances, as they, too, will feel the severe impact of demographic trends - and not only because the politically crucial median voter is going to grow older, which could incentivise policy-makers to shift burdens into the future.Despite the great complexity of the issue when viewed in detail, I can be rather brief here as the overall picture is quickly summed up. On the one side of the picture are the revenues: in Germany, the working-age population bear the brunt of the government's financing burden in the form of taxes and social contributions. On the expenditure side, the simple fact of the matter is that those of retirement age tend to be net recipients of government benefit payments.Because of the ageing of the population I have just talked about and the effects it is likely to have on economic growth, public revenues will grow more slowly in future. At the same time, expenditure will rise as a result of demographic change. The bottom line is that public finances will come under increasing strain and, in the absence of adjustments, are not sustainable. The options are either higher social contribution burdens or more debt.As the German Council of Economic Experts explains in its latest annual report, public debt in 2060 would total around 247 per cent of aggregate output unless changes were made to the status quo. By way of comparison: at the end of 2013, it was estimated at just under 77 percent, However, to continue building up new debt would be, as Kurt Beidenkopf, the former Minister President of Saxony, once put it, tantamount to issuing bills of exchange which my grandchildren will pay off.It is therefore evident that there is no way around a more stringent fiscal policy and corresponding reforms to ensure that public finances remain on a sound footing. Against this backdrop, the retirement age should not be lowered, but ought gradually to be lifted. In fact, it would be worth considering carrying out such a measure in future subject to certain rules, for example by adjusting the retirement age according to further life expectancy.Ladies and gentlemen, faced with the far-reaching economic repercussions of demographic change, we must assume that it will have implications for monetary policy, too. Although the ECBGoverning Council defines the monetary policy for the entire euro area, meaning that country-specific developments only have an indirect influence, I would like to say a few brief words about potential monetary policy problems. There is justification in that because all the large euro-area countries will be affected by an ageing society.Given the growing strain on public finances that I spoke of a few minutes ago, there is a danger that monetary policy will also experience greater political pressure to safeguard the government's solvency. What I mean is that the central bank could be pressured into pursuing a laxer monetary policy, primarily one of low interest rates, to keep government financing costs as low as possible. In this way, an increase in the real debt burden would at least be curbed via higher inflation.In an extreme scenario, this could even lead to a situation known as fiscal dominance, whereby monetary policy is harnessed to the service of fiscal policy and made to subordinate its policy to the interests of government financing. Price stability could suffer as a result. Both theory and practice teach us that in a stability-oriented economic order, the distribution of roles should be quite the opposite.This means that the task of fiscal policy-makers is to see to sound public finances, leaving the central bank free to focus its monetary policy, with as few restrictions as possible, on its own primary task of ensuring monetary stability. After all, stable money benefits everyone. This is something the founders of monetary union also realised. Indeed, the Eurosystem's independence and the fiscal policy rules that are enshrined in the treaties of the European Union are designed to allow the Eurosystem to concentrate on safeguarding price stability.It is clear, therefore, that the Eurosystem's independence is an important pillar for stable money. Yet independence and commitment to stability aren't worth very much if this principle is not shared by the population as well. Otmar Issing, who was a member of the Directorate of the Bundesbank and went on to become the ECB's chief economist, once said that every society eventually gets the rate of inflation that it deserves - and that it ultimately wanted. Demographic change, too, can play a role in this context.It seems reasonable to suppose that an ageing population would attach greater importance to monetary stability, as they would not want to see the savings accumulated during their working life and their current pension benefits eaten up by inflation. The findings of a Bundesbank study indicate - at least for Germany and the euro area - that older investors hold a greater share of assets that would be devalued through inflation.Thus, if an ageing society really does develop a stronger aversion to inflation, a stability-oriented monetary policy can look forward to growing support. Monetary policy-makers will then be better able to stick to a course of monetary stability.Ultimately, then, we are seeing two opposite effects - political pressure driven by rising debt and a growing aversion to inflation demonstrated by the ageing societies of the euro area.Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Twain once said that it's a terrible death to be talked to death. So let me leave you with the image of the rowing boat I mentioned earlier. Because demographic change means that there will be fewer and fewer people to do the rowing, it is imperative that the economic policy direction we are rowing in is the right one.Measures that promote growth, productivity and technological progress and measures that contribute to the consolidation of public finances are the right course to take.Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to answering your questions.",2014-11-27,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-11-27,"Frankfurt","Germany","""Wirtschaftsgespräche am Main"", organised by the Wirtschaftsinitiative Frankfurt/Rhein-Main e.V.","Demographic challenges in Germany",3636,22.8,5,38.5,13.5,"EN"
"2014-11-28 - BuBa - Andreas Dombret.txt","Thank you for the opportunity to speak at the Centre for Financial Studies. It is a pleasure to be here today. As you know, the Bundesbank and the Centre for Financial Studies are closely linked through various channels. The exchange between our two institutions has proved very fruitful for both sides. Thus, I am glad to be able to continue this dialogue today.Henry Kissinger once allegedly said: There cannot be a crisis next week. My schedule is already full. With that remark he captured the true nature of crises: their unpredictability. Crises usually do not adhere to people's schedules - not even to Henry Kissinger's. Instead, they occur unexpectedly - they come out of the blue, so to speak. The financial crisis was no exception in this respect.Thus, in order to prevent crises, banking supervisors as well as risk managers within banks must try to feel their way in the dark and to anticipate potential risks. This requires two things: The will to see in the dark and the ability to do so. Let us take a closer look at both issues.Dealing with risk is not something that is confined to the financial sector. It is something we all have to do every day. Crossing a street entails risk, as does eating sushi or investing in a new business venture. Yet, while we all have to deal with risks in our daily lives, it seems we are not very good at it.Much research has been conducted on how people deal with risk under different circumstances. With regard to economic decisions, this research shows that under certain circumstances people's decision are less driven by potential gain than by potential losses. Thus, they take on less risk than would be rational.Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and his co-author Amos Tversky, for instance, find that most people will reject a gamble with even odds to win or lose, unless the possible win is at least twice the size of a possible loss. So, it seems that people are not only aware of risks, but even try to avoid them more than is strictly necessary.Against this backdrop, one question comes to mind. If people are naturally risk-averse, then what was wrong with the banks in the run-up to the financial crisis? Well, in the experiments I mentioned, it was always the people's own money at stake. As soon as it is other people's money at stake, things change.Joseph Stiglitz and his co-authors, for instance, find that financial crises have become more frequent since deposit insurance systems were introduced and central banks were established as the lenders of last resort.From this, we can conclude that moral hazard plays an important role in the way banks deal with risk. The crisis has shown that we are faced with a situation in which heads, the bank wins; tails, the taxpayers lose. Liability and control are off-kilter and this reduces banks' incentives to manage risks prudently - hence their will to see in the dark is diminished. Thus, if we want to make banks care about risks, we have to restore the balance between liability and control.Here, the most prominent example is the too big to fail problem. A fundamental lesson learned from the financial crisis is that the failure of very large or interconnected banks can destabilise the entire financial system. Just think of 15 September 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the global financial crisis.Banks that are too big to fail are in a situation that is comfortable for them, but uncomfortable for society. Why is that? These banks benefit from an implicit insurance policy at no cost to themselves. They know that whenever they get into trouble, the government is likely to step in and bail them out in order to prevent a systemic meltdown.There is no doubt that this implicit insurance policy creates all the wrong incentives. If a bank can rely on state support when it gets into difficulties, it will no longer see risk and return as two sides of the same coin. Profits from risky business remain with the bank, while the taxpayer is left to bear any potential losses. Thus, to promote a sound risk culture within banks, we have to mitigate the too big to fail problem.In order to achieve this objective, we need mechanisms that allow even large banks to fail without destabilising the entire financial system. The possibility of failure is fundamental to any market economy and it must apply to banks. As the economist Allen Meltzer said: capitalism without failure is like religion without sin - it doesn't work. Only if banks see a realistic threat of failure they will have an incentive to manage risks in a prudent manner.In Europe, we have recently taken some steps in the right direction. From 2016 onwards, we will have a European resolution mechanism that allows us to resolve failing banks without destabilising the financial system and without burdening the taxpayers. In my view, this Single Resolution Mechanism has the potential to restore the balance between liability and control. Thus, it will have a fundamental and positive effect on banks' risk culture.At the global level, the G20 recently agreed upon a proposal that requires global systemically important banks to improve their capital structure. In particular, these banks will need to ensure a minimum amount of total loss-absorbing capacity, which may be as much as 20 percent, including the minimum capital requirements. This will ensure that, in case of a bank failure, it is the owner and the creditors that will have to bear the costs, not the taxpayers. This will also strengthen the incentives of banks to engage in prudent risk management.However, we have to look beyond incentives for banks. We also have to look at incentives for those who work in banks. According to the Financial Stability Board, a crucial element of a sound risk culture is the alignment of compensation with prudent risk-taking. In the past, compensation schemes were often skewed toward rewarding short-term success without taking into account related risks.Consequently, the European Union has taken action and implemented new rules. According to these rules, the variable components of bank managers' remuneration are restricted to 100 percent of the fixed components. If shareholders agree, this can be increased to 200 percent. Furthermore, banks have to establish a remuneration committee and meet several new disclosure requirements on remuneration.Nevertheless, we certainly have to be wary of regulatory arbitrage and unintended consequences. Capping the variable components of remuneration has led banks to increase the fixed components. This is likely to increase the fixed costs of banks and thus influence their competitiveness in a negative way.At the same time, the new EU rules are stricter than the rules which apply at the global level. Thus, we have to be aware of the danger of regulatory arbitrage; working toward a global level playing field for remuneration is therefore essential.Despite these caveats, I am confident that the regulatory measures will help to strengthen incentives for prudent behaviour. However, in the end it is the banks themselves that have to adopt a new culture which is focused more on sustainable returns and less on short-term gains. Here, we still have some way to go.Ladies and gentlemen, the examples of the too big to fail problem and of compensation schemes show that regulation has done a great deal to increase the willingness of banks and of bankers to see in the dark. The incentives for banks to prudently manage risks have certainly been strengthened. But are banks actually able to do so?Research in this field suggests that people are naturally disadvantaged when it comes to dealing with risks and probabilities. It is a well-established fact that people are prone to a number of systematic biases when it comes to decision-making and judgments under uncertainty. Among those biases are, for example, the neglect of base-rate information, over-confidence or incorrect perceptions regarding the frequency of certain events.But shouldn't professional risk managers be aware of these biases and be able to mitigate them? Well, it seems that even professionals are not immune to systematic biases, a view that is underpinned by at least two studies.A recent study addressed the question of whether professional managers in finance were aware of the housing bubble of 2004 to 2006. To answer this question, the researchers analysed the private investment decisions of financial managers. The results indicate that financial managers did not behave very cautiously when investing privately in the housing market. This suggests that even professionals were not aware of the bubble that had formed.In another study, stock market professionals and laypeople provided forecasts for the prices of various stocks and estimated the size of their own and the other group's errors in doing so. Both groups expected the professionals' forecasting errors to be smaller than those of the laymen. In fact, however, the errors of both groups in predicting stock prices were roughly the same. In a subsequent set-up, both groups were asked to pick the best-performing stock from two options. Here, both the professionals and the laymen proved to be overconfident with regard to their ability to pick the best-performing stock. Eventually, the professionals picked the correct stock in only 40 percent of cases. Had they randomly picked one of the two options that were offered they would have been right about 50 percent of the time.Studies such as these led Nassim Taleb to provocatively state that: certain professionals, while believing they are experts, are in fact not. Based on their empirical record, they do not know more about their subject matter than the general population, but they are much better at narrating - or worse at smoking you with complicated mathematical models. This is certainly an exaggeration, but it seems justified to conclude that our ability to see in the dark is somewhat limited.The quote points to another issue that is relevant in this regard. Can statistical models mitigate people's biases when it comes to handling risk? To some degree, they certainly can raise our awareness of potential risks but they are by no means perfect. With regard to the financial crisis, some banks claimed to have experienced a 25 sigma event - a point in the probability distribution that is 25 standard deviations away from the mean. Statistically speaking, such an event should have only occurred once since the universe came into existence.Statistical models are often criticised for systemically neglecting such high-severity-low-probability risks. One reason for this is that many models use the past as the basis for the future when assessing the probability of certain events. This weakness could be referred to as the chicken fallacy. A chicken that is fed by a farmer every morning may expect this pattern to continue in the future. However, as the philosopher Bertrand Russell concludes: The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.A second criticism with regard to risk management models is that, for the sake of practicality, they are often based on the normal distribution. The drawback of this is that these models underestimate the probability of events at the far ends of the distribution. It seems that 25 sigma events happen far more often than might be expected. Consequently, we have to be cautious and acknowledge the limits of the statistical models used in risk management and banking supervision.In the field of banking supervision, statistical models are used to calculate risk weights for assets in order to determine capital requirements. Here, studies by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision indicate that these risk weights vary across banks to a somewhat worrying degree and that not all deviations can be properly explained.Consequently, there has been some discussion about adapting the regulatory approach to these models. Among other things, it is envisaged that a capital floor will be set up based on the revised standardised approaches. In addition, consideration is being given to introducing fixed loss-given-default parameters for portfolios of unsecured loans with a low share of default. In addition, a risk-invariant leverage ratio will serve as a backstop for the risk-weighted capital requirements.In addition to high-severity-low-probability events, there will always be true black swans that appear completely unexpectedly and with dire consequences. Such events are the real challenges for risk management and financial regulation. They are intractable and cannot be managed within the scope of statistical models because they are beyond all expectations. They lurk in the dark, and we are simply unable to see them.What lessons can we learn from these observations? I would like to emphasise three points in this regard. First, we have to be aware that our knowledge is limited and our decisions are probably biased. Second, we have to acknowledge the limitations of statistical models. Third, we have to accept that black swans exist. Banks have to be prepared to handle such extreme events. In other words, risk management has to be prepared for anything at all times.What role can regulation play? If we accept that the next crisis may come unexpectedly, out of the blue, there is one key strategy - and that is to draw a line of defence which is independent of the nature of the crisis.The central building block for such a line of defence is capital, or equity, to be precise. Capital buffers are the most general means of protecting a bank from shocks, regardless of whether they are expected or come out of the blue. Consequently, the reform of financial regulation has focused on strengthening the capital rules for banks. The new Basel III framework requires banks to hold more capital of a better quality. This will make banks more resilient and better prepared to survive future crises.Ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis came out of the blue and has left a lot of damage in its wake. Hence the starting point of my speech today - that we have to attempt to feel our way in the dark in order to better anticipate future crises. This requires two things: the willingness to see in the dark and the ability to do so.With regard to the willingness to see in the dark, I talked about setting the right incentives for banks to engage in prudent risk management. The too big to fail problem and compensation schemes were two examples of how financial regulation can strengthen incentives.With regard to the ability to see in the dark, the outlook is less optimistic. Research shows that people are naturally disadvantaged when it comes to handling risks and probabilities - a deficiency that statistical models can mitigate only to a certain extent.Consequently, banks need universal buffers to prepare for shocks, regardless of where they come from. And, in this context, equity is the most general buffer. That is why the reform of financial regulation focused on improving the capital rules for banks. However, we still have to feel our way in the dark when it comes to regulation. We have increased capital buffers, but have we reached the right level? This is an issue we must endeavour to shed more light on.To sum up, crises will never adhere to our schedules, and we will never be able to prevent the threat of future crises. All we can do is to mitigate its impact. Pursuing this objective is worth all our effort and the progress that has been made in the area of financial regulation is rather encouraging.",2014-11-28,"BuBa","Andreas Dombret",2014-11-28,"Frankfurt","Germany","Centre for Financial Studies","Trying to see in the dark - The challenge of financial regulation",2616,17.7,4.9,51.7,10.3,"EN"
"2014-11-28 - BuBa - Jens Weidmann.txt","Dear Mr Kister, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to this event. It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today.I wonder if any of you have heard of Will Rogers. The man I refer to was a very well-known figure in the USA back in the twenties and thirties. Beginning his career as a lassoo artist, he went on to become one of the first big names in Hollywood. He was also a renowned documentary maker and newspaper columnist. In short: He was a true all-rounder.What is more, he was a humourist whose aphorisms are still popular as quotations today because many of them remain topical. For example, he once commented that mankind's three greatest inventions were first fire, second the wheel and third central banks.He made this assertion in 1920, in other words seven years after the Federal Reserve was established. However, its message is surprisingly relevant to today's world where many people appear to believe that central banks hold the key to resolving all our economic woes. Nowadays, central banks are viewed as the font of all wisdom in the fight against financial and sovereign debt crises and economic deficits in general. Indeed, some observers deem them to be the only capable actors gracing the stage. People's expectations of monetary policy, especially of European monetary policy, are correspondingly high.But let me make one thing clear: central banks are not magicians. And they have no wand to make all our wishes come true. In particular, it is fanciful to believe that monetary policy tools can sustainably lift the growth potential of an economy or permanently create new jobs. These goals can only be achieved through structural reforms as growth and employment are generated by innovative enterprises that offer competitive products combined with a well-trained and highly motivated workforce.In my opinion, Japan is a good illustration of this fact, although it is undoubtedly still too early to make a final assessment of that country's economic policy strategy, known as Abenomics.This approach, characterised by an expansionary monetary policy coupled with a short-term stimulative fiscal policy and growth-inducing structural reforms, was designed inter alia to shift the Japanese economy onto a higher growth path on a lasting basis.However, the preliminary effects of Japan's expansionary monetary policy and its stimulative fiscal policy are in danger of dissipating as the economic upturn was partly attributable to clear anticipatory effects prior to a VAT hike. What is more important, however, is that the announced structural reforms, notably measures to liberalise the services market and to expand labour force participation, have not actually been implemented yet.Monetary policy cannot solve structural problems. Such problems can only be remedied by political means, through growth-friendly reforms. And that is why I would like to talk to you today about what we can actually do to raise the growth potential of our economy. Please note that the observations I am about to make are not exhaustive.For example, I will not broach the subject of energy policy which is particularly relevant for German enterprises in terms of how it affects competitiveness. Nor will I be commenting on the consequences of demographic change, which I already addressed in my speech yesterday.Returning to Will Rogers' aphorism, today I intend not so much to focus on central banks per se as on the forces of fire and the wheel. For both of these inventions have galvanised productivity. Without fire we would have no energy and without the wheel there would be no mobility.It was the American Nobel prize-winning economist, Robert Solow who first showed how inventions, or technological progress as we would probably say today, and economic growth are connected, to which end he used his own model. The acclaimed Solow Growth Model may be over 50 years old but it has lost none of its effectiveness in giving crucial insights into how growth, investment and technological progress interact.One of the key insights provided by the Solow Model is that in the early stages of an economy's development, growth is driven by the accumulation of capital, whereas at a more progressed stage of its development, the chief determinant of growth is the rate of technological progress.But there is another more decisive factor at play: in the long run, it makes little sense to invest in a mature economy unless it is technologically advanced or has an abundant supply of labour at its disposal. For these two factors are key to inducing higher income expectations on the part of enterprises.Which brings us to the crux of the debate about growth-friendly economic policy in Germany and the euro area. This debate has often prompted calls for increased investment as the best way to foster growth, the argument being that such investment would raise the productive capital stock, thus stoking long-term growth potential.At the same time, it would also push up the demand for machinery and equipment and in so doing stimulate the economy, both at home and abroad. Thanks to the globalised economy, greater investment in Germany, for example, would also benefit the rest of the euro area. Without doubt, the import content of private investment is at least higher than the rather modest content constituted by government expenditure, another reason why I am against calls for a government stimulus package in Germany aimed at boosting the economy in the euro area.That said, if we take a closer look at the Solow Model we see that, more often than not, quite the reverse is true. In a market economy, demand for investment cannot simply be conjured up by decree with a view to boosting growth potential. Conversely, it is also true that increased growth and therefore higher income expectations enhance enterprises' willingness to invest.Hence, expectations pertaining to growth and income are of pivotal importance. In the case of Germany, however, demographic change has tended to exert a dampening influence, its shrinking labour force being a paramount factor hindering economic growth. For example, enterprises are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit the specialists they require. This has prompted many German enterprises to invest abroad, as reflected in Germany's high current account surpluses.Regarding the low level of investment in Germany, many commentators point to public investment, the scale of which can be directly influenced by the state. But here, too, the nexus identified by the Solow Model applies. Rates of investment lying above the growth potential of a developed economy are unlikely to increase prosperity, a fact that applies not just to public investment but also private investment.Since public net investment has been negative for some time now, there would nevertheless actually seem to be room for improvement in this area as well. No less important than the question of how much should be spent on public investment is the question of how this money should be spent. Because, as every private investor is aware, not every investment is ultimately worth the money, and the same holds true for the public sector.In any case, public investment only represents a relatively small share of total investment. And as I already indicated: such investment cannot be steered arbitrarily but should instead reflect demographic trends and productivity gains.This brings me to the all-important question: how can an economy's productivity be maximised? Here, I would like to cite another economist who delivered some major input regarding growth theory: I refer to Joseph Schumpeter, who described the growth process as one of creative destruction under which an entrepreneur develops a new product or a cheaper method of production which then enables him to steal the market from his competitors. As a result, less productive businesses disappear from the market. Overall, this serves to boost economic output.Viewed from this perspective, the competitive forces unleashed by innovative enterprises are the engine of growth - and there is ample evidence to support this assessment. For example, as a rule, the prosperity-boosting effects of the European Union have not arisen from higher trading volumes, as one might perhaps assume. Rather, studies show that the upturn in growth is mainly due to the fact that the expanded single market has intensified competition. And this increase in competition has in turn led to more innovative and therefore more productive enterprises. This insight leads us directly on to several possible ways of increasing growth potential in Germany and Europe.The single market has proven extremely successful at simplifying trade in goods. As a result, competition here is intense. Enterprises' market power does not enable them to charge large mark-ups on top of their costs; levels are similar to those in the USA, for example.Creating a transatlantic market - the TTIP is a keyword here - could thus provide even more stimulus in this regard. The USA is the EU's largest export market and its third most important import partner for trade in goods. As far as trade in services is concerned, the two regions share even closer connections.And it is precisely in the area of services that the EU still has some catching up to do in terms of intensifying competition. Mark-ups on the cost of services are on average higher than in the USA. One could say that the European Commission's Services Directive has not lived up to expectations. Creating a single market for services thus promises considerable economic benefits.The original intention behind the Services Directive was to anchor in law the home country principle, which already applies to trade in goods within the EU. This principle states that a service provider shall no longer be hindered by regulations in the importing country if it complies with national regulations in its home country. However, this principle did not make it into the final version of the directive. Yet implementing the home country principle for services, too, would have great potential - after all, services account for over two-thirds of value added in Europe.Another way to leverage growth potential were if the single market were to fully enter the digital age. Fragmentation is still part and parcel of the digital economy, in particular for legal aspects such as protecting privacy and personal data, content and copyright, the liability of online intermediaries, electronic payments and electronic contracts. The EU does not yet consist of one digital single market but 28 individual digital markets.Studies show that creating a harmonised and well regulated digital single market has the same potential as implementing the single market in its original form, which is to say an upturn in growth of as much as 4 percent. In Germany alone, as many as 420,000 new jobs could be created between 2015 and 2020.However, in the services sector barriers are not just at the European level. In Germany, they also exist for business start-ups in the form of red tape - things like mandatory administrative formalities, approval periods and fees incurred. In the World Bank's Doing Business table, Germany ranks 114th in the ease of starting a business category. In other words, there is plenty of room for improvement.Even though an enterprise's direct costs may appear to be manageable at first glance, the economic cost of difficulties entering the market and, as a result, weaker competition should not be underestimated. Studies indicate that the relatively small differences between costs of entering the market in the USAand in the EU could still account for 10 percent to 20 percent of the EU's productivity shortfall. The costs of removing red tape are comparatively low and could strengthen growth.New, innovative enterprises are key to an economy's productivity and highly competitive position. It is thus all the more important for these enterprises to have sufficient funding. A comparison between the USA and Europe shows that there is still some way to go here.New, innovative enterprises are often too small and banks frequently struggle to assess them, so they regularly raise capital in the form of equity. Venture capital has an essential role to play in this connection.The business model of a venture capital fund is based on gaining expertise in a particular business area and then investing in several start-ups in this area. Although a high percentage of these start-ups fail, profits are high if they succeed.For this business model to work, though, the market has to be large enough to enable venture capitalists to adequately diversify their investment. Furthermore, measures must be in place to ensure that lenders' rights are sufficiently protected. This is the only way to ensure that they can reap the benefits of a successful investment.There is room for improvement on the venture capital market in Europe on both accounts. On the one hand, it is highly fragmented which reduces opportunities for diversification. On the other hand, there are varying levels of protection for lenders' rights. The United Kingdom, which has by far the largest venture capital market in the EU, also has the highest level of protection. By contrast, Germany offers minority investors only a medium level of protection. However, decisions regarding protection for different groups of investors always have to be weighed up carefully.Overall, the venture capital market in the USA is five times as big as that in the EU. This could also be why innovative enterprises in the USA, measured in terms of the number of patents granted, have much easier access to capital.And with regard to the willingness to raise capital, the fact that business tax laws in Germany provide for different tax treatment of debt and equity - as highlighted again in the German Council of Economic Experts' latest report - is not very helpful either.However, it is not just in terms of growth that greater integration of European capital markets is promising. It can also help to make monetary union as a whole more resilient.Another comparison with the USA shows that equity holdings there are dispersed much more widely throughout the entire country. If a negative shock hits an industry or a specific region, then this loss is spread widely beyond that region.The same applies to positive developments, which are reflected in higher dividends. Equity investors participate directly in economic risk and in gains and losses. Creditors, on the other hand, are not exposed to losses - except in the case of insolvency.In the USA, the integrated markets for capital cushion around 40 percent of total cyclical fluctuations between the US federal states. If a regional economic downturn were to occur, the enterprises' loss in earnings in one state would then be distributed between shareholders in other states, just as these would also benefit from increased profits in a boom.Only 25 percent of cyclical fluctuations are smoothed via the credit markets, where losses are shared only in the event of an insolvency. Fiscal mechanisms cushion just 20 percent of economic shocks. Studies for the German federal states come to similar conclusions.Deeper integration of European capital markets could thus make a key contribution to improving the absorption of macroeconomic shocks and the impact of heterogeneous economic developments in the euro area.The more the capital markets exercise this buffer function, the less fiscal policy will be responsible for stabilising the economy, which has a knock-on impact on government debt. After all, experience has shown that in an upturn it is often not possible to repay debt that was incurred in a downturn to stabilise the economy. In turn, there is less pressure on monetary policymakers to support expansionary fiscal policy by easing monetary policy. Monetary policy can thus become more stable.Ladies and gentlemen, while monetary policy is able to have a short-term impact on demand in terms of safeguarding monetary stability and thus to support the economy, it cannot solve the central challenge facing the euro area, namely weak growth prospects.There will only be a sustained rise in growth and wealth in our monetary union if we cut existing red tape and promote competition.To conclude, I would like to again quote Will Rogers. There is no better place in the world to find out the shortcomings of each other than in a conference. If I have understood correctly, I believe that it is now up to you to do just that in the next few minutes, Mr Kister. I look forward to our discussion! ",2014-11-28,"BuBa","Jens Weidmann",2014-11-28,"Berlin","Germany","Wirtschaftsgipfel der Süddeutschen Zeitung","Strengthening forces for growth - Reforms geared towards boosting prosperity",2723,20.4,5,41.1,12.5,"EN"
"2014-12-01 - BuBa - Carl-Ludwig Thiele.txt","ich danke Ihnen für die Einladung zur heutigen Festveranstaltung und gratuliere der Bundesvereinigung Deutscher Geld- und Wertdienste (BDGW) im Namen der Deutschen Bundesbank ganz herzlich zum 25-jährigen Jubiläum.Meine Glückwünsche gelten aber nicht nur der BDGW als Vereinigung, sondern auch den Mitgliedsunternehmen und deren Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern.Es ist schon eine besondere Ehre, dass wir heute hier in Frankfurt – der Geburtsstadt der BDGW – im Kaisersaal des Frankfurter Römers zusammenkommen. Frankfurt ist auch der Geburtsort der Bank deutscher Länder, die bereits 1948 errichtet wurde. 1957 wurde aus der Bank deutscher Länder die Deutsche Bundesbank, die ihren Sitz direkt im Herzen Frankfurts an der Taunusanlage hatte, bevor der Neubau in Frankfurt-Ginnheim 1972 bezogen wurde. Zudem hat seit dem 1. Juni 1998 die Europäische Zentralbank in Frankfurt ihren Sitz, die gerade in der vergangenen Woche ihren Neubau im Ostend mit einem traumhaften Blick auf die Skyline bezogen hat.Erlauben Sie mir nun noch ein paar Worte zur aktuellen wirtschaftlichen Situation zu verlieren. Momentan werden die niedrigen Zinsen von verschiedener Seite aus beklagt. Ein Zins, der fast bei null liegt, führt dazu, dass zum einen sichere Kapitalanlagen nahezu keine Renditen für die Sparer abwerfen. Das erhöht letztlich natürlich auch die Attraktivität des Bargelds, was im kräftigen Anstieg des Euro- Bargeldumlaufs zum Ausdruck kommt. Zum anderen entsteht aber auch die Gefahr, dass auf längere Sicht gesehen Investoren zu hohe Risiken eingehen. Allerdings dürfen wir nicht vergessen, dass das Ziel der Bundesbank zu D-Mark-Zeiten wie auch der EZB zu Euro-Zeiten darin besteht, Preisstabilität zu gewährleisten. Damit die Inflationsrate im Euro-Raum unter, aber nahe zwei Prozent liegt, ist im gegenwärtigen wirtschaftlichen Umfeld eine sehr großzügige Geldpolitik mit außerordentlich niedrigen Zinsen notwendig. Von diesen niedrigen Zinsen profitieren die Bürgerinnen und Bürger übrigens in ihrer Eigenschaft als Arbeitnehmer, da ihre Arbeitsplätze sicherer werden, als Immobilienkäufer, da Kreditzinsen niedrig sind, und als Steuerzahler, da der Finanzminister Zinsausgaben spart.Aber zurück zum eigentlichen Thema meiner Rede: Innerhalb der vergangenen 25 Jahre hat sich das Anforderungsprofil für Ihre Branche gravierend gewandelt. Ihre Vereinigung hat sich immer flexibel gezeigt und sich auf neue Rahmenbedingungen eingestellt. Offensichtlich wurde dies auch mit der Umbenennung Ihres Verbandes von Bundesvereinigung Deutscher Geld- und Werttransporte in Bundesvereinigung Deutscher Geld- und Wertdienste im Jahr 2002.Ich möchte mich heute im Namen der Deutschen Bundesbank für die konstruktive Zusammenarbeit mit der BDGW bedanken. Bei dieser Gelegenheit möchte ich die Position der Bundesbank zu ausgewählten Bargeldthemen verdeutlichen. Gestatten Sie mir zunächst einige allgemeine Anmerkungen zur Bedeutung von Bargeld, dem uns verbindenden Medium.In den vergangenen 25 Jahren hat sich im baren Zahlungsverkehr einiges bewegt. In diese Zeitspanne fallen unter anderem die Einführung der D-Mark nach dem Fall der Mauer in der damaligen DDR und die Einführung des Euro für alle Bundesbürger, mit der sich der Währungsraum erheblich vergrößert hat.Die Schaffung des Eurosystems hat unweigerlich zur Vermischung der unterschiedlichen Kulturen und Gebräuche in den nationalen Bargeldkreisläufen geführt. Daneben haben die zunehmende Automation in Form von Cash-Recycling-Geräten und der sukzessive Rückzug der Banken aus dem eigenständigen Bargeldhandling – durch Aufgabe beziehungsweise Outsourcing der Hauptkassenfunktion – die Herausforderungen für Ihre Vereinigung und die Aufgaben Ihrer Mitgliedsunternehmen erheblich gewandelt. Zum klassischen Geld- und Werttransportgeschäft sind Aufgaben im Bargeldmanagement hinzugekommen, so zum Beispiel das Zählen und Abstimmen der Einzahlungseinheiten, das Aufbereiten der Banknoten für Geldausgabeautomaten in Ihren Cash Centern und der Geldautomaten-Service für Banken. Dies alles bietet Ihrer Branche ein breites Spektrum an Dienstleistungen.Obwohl Bargeld zunehmend im Vergleich – ja mitunter sogar im Wettbewerb – mit unbaren Zahlungsmitteln steht, ist dessen Beliebtheit in Deutschland weiterhin ungebrochen. Schon Dostojewski sagte 1861: Geld bedeutet doch geprägte Freiheit. Da es sich zu dieser Zeit nur um Münzen handeln konnte, denn nur Münzen sind geprägt, war selbstverständlich Bargeld gemeint. Dieses scheint auch heute noch die Mehrheit der Bürger so zu sehen. Die Analysen der Deutschen Bundesbank zeigen am Verkaufspunkt oder Neudeutsch am Point of Sale (PoS) eine klare Bargeldpräferenz der Verbraucher. Nach unserer vergangenen Studie aus dem Jahr 2011 wird Bargeld bei mehr als 80 Prozent aller Transaktionen genutzt – primär für Kleinbetragszahlungen. Der wertmäßige Anteil beläuft sich mit 53 Prozent auf mehr als die Hälfte aller Transaktionen.Dennoch beobachten wir, dass der hohe Bargeldanteil am PoS in Deutschland langsam, aber kontinuierlich abnimmt. Ob und wie sich dieser Trend fortsetzt, hängt unter anderem von dem technischen Fortschritt bei baren und unbaren Zahlungsmitteln, dem Konsumentenverhalten und der Akzeptanz technischer Innovationen ab. Auch die Preispolitik der Anbieter von Bargelddienstleistungen im Verhältnis zu der Preispolitik für unbare Bezahlverfahren ist relevant. Wir warten derzeit sehr gespannt auf die Ergebnisse unserer laufenden Studie – der dritten Studie – zum Zahlungsverhalten in Deutschland, über die ich voraussichtlich im ersten Quartal des nächsten Jahres berichten werde.Erlauben Sie mir dennoch zu mutmaßen: Bargeld wird bis auf weiteres das meistgenutzte Zahlungsmittel am Point of Sale sein. Somit bleibt unsere gemeinsame Arbeitsgrundlage Bargeld auch in Zukunft erhalten, wobei ich betonen möchte, dass die Deutsche Bundesbank die Entscheidung der Bürgerinnen und Bürger, mit Bargeld oder mit Karte zu bezahlen, weiterhin nicht beeinflussen wird.Die BDGW und die Deutsche Bundesbank blicken auf eine langjährige erfolgreiche, vertrauensvolle und konstruktive, wenn auch nicht immer konfliktfreie Beziehung zurück, die insbesondere von gegenseitigem Respekt und Fairness geprägt war und ist. Diese gemeinsame Basis ist unerlässlich, um dem Bargeldkreislauf zu mehr Sicherheit zu verhelfen.Bargeldversorgung in Deutschland heißt, zusammen mit allen Akteuren im Bargeldkreislauf Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Die BDGW und ihre Mitgliedsunternehmen haben in der jüngeren Vergangenheit mehrmals bewiesen, dass sie einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Bargeldversorgung in Deutschland leisten. Die BDGWmacht durch ihre Haltung immer wieder deutlich, dass sie nicht als reine Interessenvertreterin ihrer Mitglieder verstanden werden darf und auch nicht verstanden werden will. Die BDGW hat das Erarbeiten von Lösungen zur Verbesserung des Bargeldkreislaufs fest im Blick. Dies möchte ich am Beispiel der europäischen Verordnung zur Durchführung von grenzüberschreitenden Bargeldtransporten verdeutlichen: Die BDGW hat sich intensiv mit dieser Verordnung auseinander gesetzt und bietet deshalb mit dem Cross Border Training Pass für ihr Sicherheitspersonal – nach meinem Kenntnisstand als Erste in Europa – ein strukturiertes Schulungsprogramm zur Begleitung von grenzüberschreitenden Bargeldtransporten an.Wer selbst konstruktiv an Lösungen arbeitet und nicht nur andere zum Handeln auffordert, verdient Lob.Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, aus dem Hier und Jetzt möchte ich Ihren Blick gerne in die jüngere Vergangenheit lenken: Die Euro-Bargeld-Einführung im Jahr 2002 wäre ohne das Know-how und den besonderen Einsatz der Wertdienstleistungs-Branche in Deutschland nicht so reibungslos möglich gewesen. Der Bargeldaustausch für rund 82 Millionen Menschen als Big Bang innerhalb weniger Wochen war in Deutschland beispiellos. Für alle Bargeldakteure, aber insbesondere für Ihre Branche, sehr geehrter Herr Mewes, waren die Wochen um den Jahreswechsel 2001/2002 mit besonderen Anstrengungen verbunden.Trotz der vorzeitigen Abgabe von Euro-Banknoten und -Münzen ab dem 1. September 2001 durch die Deutsche Bundesbank hat Ihre Branche eine logistische Meisterleistung vollbracht. Dabei ging es nicht nur um eine flächendeckende Versorgung mit dem neuen Euro-Bargeld, sondern auch um den Rücktransport der D-Mark-Banknoten und -Münzen zur Deutschen Bundesbank – und das innerhalb kurzer Zeit. Dabei konnten Sie nicht einfach ihre Ressourcen, zum Beispiel die Anzahl der gepanzerten Fahrzeuge, beliebig hoch- oder zurückfahren, sondern es war ein gutes Ressourcen-Management gefragt. Damit das alles funktionierte, hatte die BDGW seinerzeit intensiv am Konzept zur Inverkehrgabe von Euro-Bargeld in Deutschland mitgearbeitet, das unter Federführung der Deutschen Bundesbank gemeinsam mit weiteren Bargeldakteuren erstellt wurde. Die erfolgreiche Euro-Bargeldeinführung in Deutschland hat gezeigt, wie wichtig die koordinierende Funktion Ihrer Vereinigung in Kombination mit einem funktionierenden Unterbau – also Ihren Mitgliedsunternehmen – ist. Gleiches gilt natürlich auch für die D-Mark-Einführung in den neuen Bundesländern, die sich nächstes Jahr zum 25. Mal jährt.Beide Ereignisse haben das gute Ansehen und die wichtige Funktion Ihrer Branche – auch in der Öffentlichkeit – deutlich untermauert. Dank Ihrer hervorragenden Arbeit innerhalb Ihres Verbandes konnte auch die Heros-Insolvenz im Jahr 2006 dem Image Ihrer Branche nicht nachhaltig schaden. Der Zusammenbruch von Heros mit einem Marktanteil von rund 50 Prozent konnte nur durch eine außergewöhnlich flexible und schnelle Reaktion Ihrer Branche und aller Beteiligten im Bargeldkreislauf abgefedert werden. Die Ihnen angeschlossenen Unternehmen haben ohne weiteres Zögern die Bargeld-Dienstleistungen für die betroffenen Heros-Kunden im Rahmen ihrer Möglichkeiten übernommen. Dem vorausgegangen ist natürlich die rasche Steuerungs- und Kommunikationsarbeit Ihrer Vereinigung. Am Ende ist es Ihrer Branche gelungen, durch die im Jahr 2007 etablierten BDGW-Sicherheitsstandards gestärkt aus diesem Ereignis herauszugehen.Doch die Ruhe nach der Heros-Insolvenz sollte nicht lange andauern, und wieder einmal war der kurzfristige Einsatz Ihrer Branche notwendig. Die Insolvenz der US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers im September 2008 ging einher mit einer sprunghaft angestiegenen Banknotennachfrage. Dieses Ereignis hat gezeigt, dass nicht nur die Deutsche Bundesbank mit ihren Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern in ihren Filialen für solche Ausnahmefälle gerüstet sein muss, sondern auch die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter in den Unternehmen Ihrer Branche. Ergänzend zu der logistischen Herausforderung hat Ihre Branche im Zusammenspiel mit den anderen Bargeldakteuren eine wichtige Steuerungsfunktion übernommen. Aus gutem Grund wurde die gestiegene Bargeldnachfrage im Stillen abgewickelt, um keine weitere Beunruhigung der Öffentlichkeit herbeizuführen.Die beiden genannten Ereignisse – Heros und Lehman Brothers – haben uns deutlich vor Augen geführt, dass Sie und wir auf Ausnahmesituationen, und insbesondere auf Not- und Krisenfälle, vorbereitet sein müssen.Der Gesetzgeber hat mit dem Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz eine Regelung beschlossen, die die Lehren aus der Heros-Krise berücksichtigt. Es bleibt für mich unverständlich, warum trotz dieses klaren Beschlusses des Deutschen Bundestages bislang noch kein Unternehmen eine entsprechende Zertifizierung erhalten hat.Daher ist es besonders wichtig, dass alle Beteiligten im Bargeldkreislauf auch in Zukunft an sogenannten Business Continuity Plänen arbeiten. Die Bundesbank hat hierzu bereits Gespräche mit der Kreditwirtschaft aufgenommen. Im Weiteren werden auch Gespräche mit Ihrer Branche und dem Handel als unmittelbar beteiligte Bargeldakteure in Deutschland erfolgen. Die Expertise gerade Ihrer Branche ist für unser langfristiges Ziel sehr wertvoll: Ein abgestimmtes Konzept aller Bargeldakteure zur Bewältigung von Ausnahmesituationen, um die Sicherheit und Stabilität der Bargeldversorgung gemeinsam zu gewährleisten.Beim Thema Business Continuity herrscht eine große Deckungsgleichheit zwischen den Beteiligten im Bargeldkreislauf. Das ist nicht immer selbstverständlich. Schließlich handeln Wertdienstleister, Kreditwirtschaft und Handel nach betriebswirtschaftlichen Kriterien, während die Deutsche Bundesbank aufgrund ihres gesetzlichen Sorgeauftrages bei ihren Entscheidungen häufig gesamtwirtschaftliche Aspekte in den Vordergrund stellen muss.Daher sind die Ziele der BDGW und die der Deutschen Bundesbank nicht immer identisch. Dies offenbarte auch die Klage der BDGW wegen der Entgeltpolitik im Zusammenhang mit der Einführung der Multistückelungsbearbeitung im Jahr 2007. Die Details, die zur gerichtlichen Auseinandersetzung geführt haben, müssen wir hier nicht wiederholen. Betonen möchte ich an dieser Stelle aber, dass nach der vom Landgericht Frankfurt abgewiesenen Klage der BDGW gegen die Deutsche Bundesbank eine rasche Rückkehr zur sachlichen Diskussion möglich war.Dass unser gemeinsamer Dialog fortgesetzt wird, zeigen beispielsweise die jährlich stattfindenden Parlamentarischen Abende als Informations- und Kommunikationsplattform und unsere Jahresgespräche.Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, gestatten Sie mir, die heutige Gelegenheit zu nutzen und einen kurzen Blick auf aktuelle Entwicklungen zu werfen.Die oft – auch von Ihrer Vereinigung – kritisierte EU-Münzverordnung aus dem Jahr 2010 ist in Teilen durchaus gerechtfertigt. Einige Vorgaben erscheinen praxisfern zu sein. Selbst lange Übergangsfristen reichen für die im Münzgeschäft tätigen Bargeldakteure nicht aus, um die aus den Anforderungen resultierenden Schwierigkeiten zu beseitigen.Daher wird sich die Deutsche Bundesbank weiterhin für Bedingungen hinsichtlich des privaten Münzrecyclings einsetzen, die in der Praxis leichter umsetzbar sind. Doch uns allen muss klar sein: Falls Anpassungen seitens der EU-Kommission erfolgen sollten, können diese nicht von heute auf morgen beschlossen werden. Dass die Deutsche Bundesbank den Willen des Gesetzgebers umsetzen wird, ist selbstverständlich. Die Deutsche Bundesbank wird aber – soweit sachgerecht – ihren Ermessensspielraum nutzen.In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich auf das Online-Schulungsportal der Deutschen Bundesbank für Münzen und Banknoten verweisen. Hiermit bieten wir den Bargeldakteuren ein pragmatisches Instrument an, ihrer Pflicht, nur geschultes Personal einzusetzen, rechtssicher nachzukommen.Eine weitere wichtige Entwicklung aus Sicht der Deutschen Bundesbank ist die Etablierung von Standards im bargeldbezogenen IT-Bereich gemeinsam mit allen Marktakteuren. Genau zu diesem Zweck hat sich erfreulicherweise im Jahr 2012 die sogenannte Cash-Community unter der Federführung von GS1 (Global Standards One) gebildet. Sie ist eine offene Plattform von Bargeldakteuren und besteht unter anderem aus Vertretern Ihrer Branche, der Banken, der Versicherer, des Handels und der Software-Industrie. Im Vordergrund steht vor allem die Optimierung der Bargeldprozesse in Deutschland auf Basis des GS1-Standards. Erste Erfolge sind schon zu verzeichnen. In diesem Jahr wurden Pilot- und Referenzprojekte zwischen Handelsketten, IT-Providern und Wertdienstleistern gestartet, bei denen GS1-Standards genutzt werden, die auch für die CashEDI-Transaktionen (Cash Electronic Data Interface) mit der Deutschen Bundesbank Verwendung finden.Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, schon mein kurzer Ausblick macht deutlich, dass neue Herausforderungen vor der Tür stehen, die unser gemeinsames Engagement erfordern. Zugleich können Sie sicher sein, dass sich die Deutsche Bundesbank immer für einen effizienten nationalen Bargeldkreislauf stark machen und dabei gleichzeitig den grenzüberschreitenden europäischen Zahlungsverkehr nicht aus den Augen verlieren wird.In diesem Sinne freuen wir uns, weiterhin einen konstruktiven und offenen Dialog mit der BDGW zu pflegen und die vertrauensvolle Zusammenarbeit wie bisher fortzuführen, um die Bargeldversorgung in Deutschland sicherzustellen und den deutschen Bargeldkreislauf stetig effizienter und sicherer zu machen.Ich möchte Ihnen die Bedeutung des Bargeldes anhand der ausgegebenen Banknoten noch einmal verdeutlichen: Im Januar 2002 betrug der Banknotenumlauf 221 Mrd. Euro. Ende des Jahres 2002 waren es schon 358 Mrd. Euro. Der Banknotenumlauf ist seitdem kontinuierlich gestiegen, allein in den vergangenen fünf Jahren um durchschnittlich 5 Prozent pro Jahr. Am 31. Dezember 2013 betrug der Umlauf 956 Mrd. Euro, Ende Oktober diesen Jahres betrug er 975 Mrd. Euro. Betrachtet man die Entwicklung der vergangenen Jahre jeweils zum Jahresende, so erhöhte sich der Banknotenumlauf um circa 25 Mrd. Euro. Sollte sich diese Entwicklung auch im laufenden Jahr fortsetzen, dann würde um die Jahreswende die unvorstellbare Zahl von gut 1.000 Mrd. Euro Banknotenumlauf erreicht.Trotz des ausgerufenen War on Cash und dem Ruf Einzelner nach einer ausschließlich bargeldlosen Währung bin ich mir absolut sicher, dass Bargeld weiter eine Zukunft hat. Die Entwicklung am Point of Sale wird die Deutsche Bundesbank weiterhin aufmerksam beobachten. Ich wünsche Ihnen, Herr Mewes, der BDGW, den angeschlossenen Unternehmen und den Beschäftigten viel Erfolg für die Zukunft.",2014-12-01,"BuBa","Carl-Ludwig Thiele",2014-12-01,"Frankfurt","Germany","25-jähriges Jubiläum der Bundesvereinigung Deutscher Geld- und Wertdienste e.V.","Die künftige Bargeldversorgung in Deutschland aus Sicht der Deutschen Baundesbank",2272,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DE"
"2014-12-03 - BuBa - Joachim Nagel.txt","It gives me great pleasure to address this Handelsblatt Annual Conference today. All Digital - All Mobile - All Compliant, the motto of this year's annual conference on banking technology, points to the major challenges faced by the IT departments of financial institutions.In my capacity as a member of the Bundesbank's Executive Board, I am responsible for the Markets and Information Technology Departments. So I am familiar with some of the problems and difficulties associated with a bank's IT infrastructure. On the one hand, the yardstick by which a bank's chief information officer (CIO) is measured is the way in which he or she supports the institution's core business areas by delivering high-quality ITservices and products, which should ideally be standardised and streamlined. IT security is coming increasingly into play here. On the other hand, he or she is also expected to demonstrate a high level of agility and innovative ability in the face of stiffer competition, including from enterprises outside the traditional banking sector. Together with all other business units, then, it is important for banks' IT to reap greater business benefits by implementing joint projects and employing innovative information technology.It is crucial that we recognise and harness the business relevance of trends in the field of information technology - trends such as mobility, as referred to in the conference's motto. Big data, datability, social media and cloud computing undoubtedly all open up additional major opportunities for banks. Yet at the same time they pose new challenges, especially with respect to ITsecurity.Today, I would like to shed some light on the third facet of this event's motto - All Compliant - with regard to the European banking union.The German Corporate Governance Code defines compliance as adherence to legal provisions and corporate guidelines, which falls within the responsibility of senior management. Compliance therefore means adhering to and satisfying legal and regulatory requirements. The financial community is now confronted with many new and revised requirements and conditions, particularly as a result of regulation adopted in the course of the financial and sovereign debt crisis. Banks need to demonstrate their regulatory compliance with these, which also has a direct impact on their IT.The current financial and sovereign debt crisis has also exposed flaws in the architecture of banking supervision. I would therefore like to highlight four weak points that we have either eliminated or are working towards eliminating on the road to a European banking union. Consistent European banking supervisionBanking supervision at the national level was replaced on 4 November 2014 by direct, ECB-led supervision of the largest European banks. Under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), all prudential reporting data from significant banks are now collected by a central authority, with information assessed in a manner that allows cross-border comparisons to be drawn. Harmonisation of banking supervision The establishment of a uniform prudential framework has brought about greater harmonisation of banking oversight in member states, with regulatory arbitrage being prevented by shifting responsibility for banking supervision and resolution to the European level. Liability cascade in the event of resolution One lesson the crisis has taught us is that no bank should be too big to fail: if the worst comes to the worst, they must be able to fail. The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) defines this usually self-evident liability cascade, according to which shareholders and creditors are first and second in line to absorb any losses. Taxpayers are the last link in this chain of liability. Capital backing for government bonds On the other hand, high levels of sovereign debt can also destabilise the domestic banking sector - I am referring specifically to the zero risk weighting of government bonds. In future, this vicious circle between sovereign and banking risks could be broken by implementing appropriate measures. After all, we have seen that government bonds are not risk-free. That is why the preferential regulatory treatment afforded to government bonds and other exposures to the public sector, in particular, needs to be brought to an end.The idea behind the banking union is a common financial regulatory framework, known as the Single Rulebook, and rests on two main pillars.The first pillar is central, joint responsibility for banking supervision under the aegis of the ECB. This has already been put in place in the shape of the SSM.The second pillar is the SRM, which is responsible for the recovery and resolution of insolvent banks in times of crisis. The SRM is a necessary complement to the SSM and, together, they represent two sides of the same coin: they aim to facilitate the orderly recovery or resolution of institutions in the event of insolvency.There was also talk of a third pillar in the form of a single deposit guarantee scheme. But this would entail joint, cross-border fiscal responsibility, which is a step that policymakers are not yet prepared to take. The recently revised EU Directive on deposit guarantee schemes did, however, bring about greater harmonisation in European deposit guarantee schemes.It is now more or less exactly one month since the SSM came into force. On 4 November, the ECB took on the far-reaching supervisory responsibilities assigned to it for credit institutions in the euro area. In the SSM, the ECB and the euro-area national competent authorities work together. The division of tasks between the European and national institutions is based on the distinction between significant and less significant institutions. Specifically, the following institutions are defined as significant: banks with total assets of more than €30 billion or more than 20 percent of national GDP with total assets also in the latter case having to amounting to at least €5 billion; banks receiving direct or indirect assistance from the EFSF or the ESM; the three most significant credit institutions in an SSM member state. These are either/or criteria. This means that one criterion alone is sufficient to classify the institution as significant. For such significant institutions - at present, there are 120 of them with roughly 85 percent of aggregate total assets across all banks - the ECBis taking on complete supervision.For the 3,600 less significant institutions across Europe these tasks will be performed by the national supervisory authorities. So, about 1,700 German institutions will still be subject to ongoing supervision by the Bundesbank and potential measures by BaFin. Nevertheless, the ECB exercises oversight over the system as a whole. The ECB is to ensure consistent and high-quality supervisory practice in the SSM by setting standards and issuing instructions. The European Banking Authority (EBA) is responsible for the development of regulatory standards for European banks; compliance is a matter for the ECB and the national competent authorities.European supervision will make a major contribution to the integration of the financial markets by means of uniform standards the separation of bank and sovereign risks and the stability of the financial market. From an IT perspective, the SSM will introduce new work processes as well as changes in the exchange of information and reporting channels. Via the national competent authorities (NCAs) - in Germany, through the Bundesbank - the ECB will be receiving the reporting data of all banks in the SSM area, irrespective of the significance of the given institution. For significant banks, the Bundesbank will become a supplier of data to the ECB. The data reported by the NCAs are analysed by the ECB and serve as a basis for regulatory decisions about significant institutions.For non-significant institutions, the national applications will continue to exist, but will be adapted in future to harmonised European specifications.Supervision of the significant banks will be undertaken by joint supervisory teams (JSTs). A JST is being established for each of these institutions. These teams will be headed by a coordinator who is a member of staff of the ECB. The teams themselves are largely made up of staff from the national competent authorities. In future, the supervisors will have access to the ECB banking supervisory applications via the SSM Information Management System (IMAS).IMAS will provide the infrastructure to ensure harmonised processes and consistency in the supervision of banking institutions. It is a key element for safeguarding the application of the common methodology and standards by all the JSTs.The system offers ECB decision-makers and banking supervisors efficient access to operational and analytical data via a stable and user-friendly interface. The first harmonised application in the European regulatory framework is designed for receiving and analysing institutions' solvency and financial data from all the SSM countries based on the XBRL format in conformity with the EBA's technical implementing standards.The implementation of the new supervisory standards has become the greatest challenge for the financial industry since the Lehman insolvency according to a recent Forrester study. It finds that, from a corporate viewpoint, compliance with regulatory requirements has the highest priority, with 60 percent in agreement. This is followed by improved customer services and operational efficiency, which have a lower ranking. The direct costs associated with this for the banking industry in Germany as a result of regulation in the period from 2010 to 2015 also represent a challenge, however. According to a study by KPMG, these are projected to total around €9 billion.Reports in the press recently made frequent mention of a wave of regulation inundating the banks' IT. There was even talk of excessive regulation or a regulatory tsunami. With all sympathy for the great challenges that the banks are facing, we should not forget why these demands arose. They were due to sometimes glaring errors in developments and to a lack of meaningful possibilities of analysing the data that existed at the banks - both before the crisis and to this very day.What we have observed from inspections at the banks is that IT at most banks is suffering from data not being collected and maintained in accordance with uniform standards and that there are only limited automated facilities for analysing these data and thus utilising them for a forward-looking risk management. Risk silos exist.The outcome of this is that the management often finds itself in a situation where decisions have to be made with insufficient knowledge of the facts. This chiefly concerns banks with an international focus, which admittedly find it difficult to coordinate IT spread over a large number of locations. More than for others, however, it is absolutely essential for them to do so in order to hold their own in a volatile economic environment. The whole thing is not just a problem for German banks; according to a study by the Basel Committee, it concerns more or less all international banks. It goes without saying that no data graveyards should be created. I think that, together with the financial institutions, we will strike a healthy and, above all, viable balance in the future as well. Furthermore, many of the regulations have not been newly invented; they are already national banking supervision reality.In Germany, for example, the implementation of section 25 of the Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz, KWG) and the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (Mindestanforderungen an das Risikomanagement, MaRisk) means that many of the mentioned requirements are already common practice among supervisors.Warren Buffett is quoted as saying Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. As I see it, the IT departments that have consistently and promptly implemented the requirements of earlier inspection practice are well equipped for the future demands of IT.The new Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting (BCBS 239) adopted by the Basel Committee at the beginning of 2013 will apply initially from 2016 to global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). A bank is deemed to be systemically important in global terms if its insolvency would severely impede the functioning of the global financial system or significant parts thereof, and would also have negative effects on the real economy. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has classified 30 institutions worldwide as systemically important, including Deutsche Bank as the sole German institution. It is already envisaged that this will be extended to domestic systemically important banks.Risk information should be complete, correct, consistent and current and made available in a form appropriate to the addressees. This has always been a demand of the supervisory authorities. However, the Basel standards now set out, for the first time, globally coordinated, specific regulatory requirements for the architecture of risk and data management.The implementation of these provisions should make possible improved management information across all legal entities, an improved quality of strategic planning options and a complete assessment of the risk exposure at the highest consolidated level. Responsibility for this lies with senior management.The regulatory provisions will lead to a harmonisation of IT infrastructures, flexible and consistent processes in risk management and to enhanced analytical capabilities.The challenges in implementing these principles are highly ambitious and will require considerable input in terms of human resources and technology. This applies in particular to risk management, finance and information technology. In the medium and long term, however, this will also bring many opportunities. Even at an early stage, it should be possible to assess risks more quickly and more reliably; there will also be a crucial improvement in the quality of the basic elements of management. These changes are therefore also in the interests of the enterprises themselves.The requirements placed on institutions by the SSM have been a catalyst for major changes in the relevant business areas and IT departments, particularly with regard to reporting data.The expansion of the report contents has led to a marked increase in the volume of data to be submitted. For example, a tenfold rise in volume is expected for harmonised solvency and financial data. Another new aspect is that large institutions' reports of large exposures exceeding €300 million could contain up to 200 MB of data per submission. And I must confess that the European harmonisation of credit reporting is still in its infancy and further requirements are on the cards. Given the sheer scale of affected data, Big Data with innovative analytical, visualisation and reporting tools as well as in-memory technology will gain greater importance in banks' IT, if they haven't done so already.Up until now, many data were already aggregated by institutions as part of the reporting process and the total figures were submitted to the supervisory authority. It is now increasingly the case that individual data are required, which are then aggregated by banking supervisors. The information and data to be reported by banks are now considerably more granular and serve as a basis for extended analyses in the field of banking supervision.Institutions need to get used to the idea that regulatory requirements will have to be implemented in a much shorter space of time. Time pressure and the associated planning uncertainty are likely to pose the main problems in this respect. Up until now, there has been a time lag of about one year between the publication of new requirements by the Bundesbank and the first-time submission of data in line with these new requirements. In the wake of the launch of the SSM, the EBA has now reduced this timeframe to 2-3 months. The same applies to completely new areas for which there was previously no systematic collection of data.The advantages of XBRL as the lingua franca for exchanging financial information is obvious. Data structures based on defined, uniform procedures allow information to be transmitted in a more efficient manner that is less prone to errors, and subsequently processed and evaluated. The complexity of taxonomies and reporting formats and the resulting increased volume of data are just some of the disadvantages compared with the previous, more simple formats. These directly impact on IT, placing greater demands on IT infrastructures, such as processor performance and storage requirements. Banks therefore need to upgrade their capabilities.The previous interfaces between commercial banks and supervisory authorities have changed. Up to now, incoming reports were only subjected to syntactic checks, with technical verification taking place as a downstream process. At the Bundesbank, for example, Bundesbank staff reported any inconsistencies to the respective institutions. The correction could then be made by the institution in consultation with this member of staff.Gradually - the process started back on 1 April 2014 with COREP (common solvency ratio reporting) - the submission and correction process will be automated as far as possible, as the SSM continues to takes shape. The reported data will be machine-checked for technical correctness as well as subjected to initial specialist entry checks. At the end of the process, erroneous reports will be automatically rejected. Each individual submission will be subjected to several thousand automated checks. Institutions must expect error messages and be able to deal with not yet standardised contents and formats. Overarching examinations of economic, financial and large exposure data mean that institutions will need to cross-check figures down to the very last detail, even if they stem from different systems.The timeframe for corrections by institutions is being reduced. This means, inter alia, that banks' internal correction processes need to be made more efficient and consistent, which might require more resources.I think that the challenges I have presented can be summarised in the following areas of action for banks' IT financial architecture: Data governance and data architecture need to be optimised in order to enhance the quality, accuracy and integrity of data. Analytical and reporting processes need to facilitate faster decision-making and direct availability of the relevant information. Processes and databases for the areas of finance, control and risk need to be harmonised. Increased automation of the data exchange processes with the supervisory authorities is required. Fast and flexible implementation of supervisory requirements by business units and IT necessitates a modular and flexible architecture and appropriate project management methods. Banks must ensure that their IT is equipped for this.Further developments and framework conditions are in the pipeline: The SSM is gradually harmonising the banking supervision reporting system at the European level. Thus, new frameworks are continually being developed in a European context. The ECB and EBA are setting out requirements in liaison with the national competent authorities. COREP and large exposure reporting have already had to report for the first time in line with European requirements. The requirements concerning the scope and contents of reporting have increased significantly, while the response times for new requirements have been slashed. This trend looks set to continue in the future.  New standards such as BCBS 239 require the relevant institutions to have integrated and automated data processing in place. European harmonisation of credit reporting is presently being discussed (Analytical Credit Dataset - AnaCredit). It will be fundamentally different from the current reporting system. We are expecting regulations which lead to an increased number of metrics, and which additionally have a finer granularity. Furthermore, lower reporting thresholds and increased reporting frequencies are on the cards. In my opinion, there are two key messages: Banks need to invest in their information technology. The implementation of supervisory requirements will tie up considerable resources and entail costs. Regulatory projects reduce operational risk, permit a better and faster assessment of risks and possible courses of action. This can, in turn, diminish operating costs and offer a crucial competitive edge.Ladies and gentlemanTo achieve our common goal of making financial markets more stable, the various bank governance functions - in particular, risk management, reporting and finance - need to be much better integrated than they have been up to now. Overarching data and methodological governance, and the integration of processes and IT systems need to oust the existing silos and monolithic systems. Furthermore, institutions need to be capable of safeguarding flexible and timely reporting for different target groups.Thus the modernisation of IT systems is one of the big challenges faced by banks. Institutions want to keep their costs for fulfilling new - above all regulatory - requirements to a minimum. To do this, they will have to modernise their IT architecture. The Senior Supervisors Group emphasised the importance of strong ITgovernance, bringing together business units and IT, in its 2010 report. This is also a key point for me:  IT strategy needs to be embedded in the business strategy. The necessary transformations must not be an end in themselves from an IT perspective, but need to be strategically anchored and founded on business policy. Many regulatory requirements have been necessary precisely because banks' systems are not integrated. Only a holistic cross-business approach can take IT financial architecture to the next strategic level.",2014-12-03,"BuBa","Joachim Nagel",2014-12-03,"Frankfurt","Germany","20.
